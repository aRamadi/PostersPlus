# URL reference

What goes in a poster URL, and how the overlays behind it decide what to show. You don't need any of this to get started: the configurator builds the URL for you. It's here for when you want to hand-edit one or understand why a poster looks the way it does.

## Poster URLs

Posters are served at `/poster` with parameters controlling every aspect of rendering:

```
https://yourdomain.com/poster?tmdb_id={tmdb_id}&type={type}
```

Either id identifies the title — `tmdb_id`, `imdb_id`, or a `tt…` value in `stremio_id` — and sending both is best. `tmdb_id` selects the artwork and the metadata directly. An `imdb_id` on its own is resolved to a TMDB id first (TMDB's `/find`, persisted so it costs one call per title ever), and the request then renders exactly as if the client had sent both; if TMDB says the IMDb id is a series rather than a movie, TMDB's type wins. `imdb_id` alongside `tmdb_id` is optional enrichment — send it if your client has one reliably (the Plex and Jellyfin sync scripts do) and it keys the rating cache by IMDb id, sharing that row with every other client. Neither id should be *required* in a template. A required placeholder with no value makes the resolver discard the entire URL, so the title gets no poster at all — and both ids hit that: TMDB has no IMDb link for some titles, and a client's catalogue often has no TMDB id for one (Nuvio's frequently doesn't). Since either id renders on its own, the optional `{name?}` form is the right one for both on the clients that implement it: an id that resolves to empty is simply not sent. The configurator emits exactly that for those clients.

### Client templates

Which placeholders a URL may use is a fact about the client that resolves them, not a preference, so the configurator's **Copy config** button picks the shape for you:

There are only two shapes of identity behind the list:

| Client | Identity parameters |
|---|---|
| AIOMetadata, Nuvio, Bingecat, Xperience | `tmdb_id={tmdb_id?}&imdb_id={imdb_id?}&stremio_id={id}&type={type}&shape={shape}` |
| Discover+ | `tmdb_id={tmdb_id}&type={type}` |

AIOMetadata, Nuvio, Bingecat and Xperience all resolve Nuvio's placeholder set, optional `{name?}` form and `{shape}` included, so they share one URL, which carries the TMDB and MDBList keys typed into the configurator as literals. Discover+ accepts a `{name?}` URL but then serves nothing for it, so it gets the short form; once it gains the form every client shares a single URL.

`shape={shape}` is filled with the shape the catalogue asked for. One URL then covers the portrait slot, the 16:9 slot and the Continue Watching backdrop, where Discover+ needs the landscape URL copied separately from the landscape view. The placeholder's presence is the switch — without it Nuvio replaces only portrait posters and leaves the other shapes with their own art — so **Copy config** emits it and the landscape choices ride along whichever way the preview is pointing. The settings the configurator keeps per shape travel twice on it — the portrait value under the plain name, the landscape one as `landscape_<name>` — so each layout renders with its own; the URL is the same whichever view you copy it from, and any value a render would pick anyway is left out.

Left-click copies the shared URL, or the Discover+ one if that is what you last picked from the menu; right-click opens the menu (Default, Discover+ and Share settings), as does a press-and-hold on touch. The choice is remembered per browser and is not part of the saved configuration, so an imported or shared config URL never carries someone else's client with it.

Required is the right form for the short template: `tmdb_id` is the only id those clients can send, so a title they have no TMDB id for has nothing to render from, and nulling the URL leaves the client's own poster in place. Nothing visible is lost by its missing `imdb_id` — `tmdb_id` identifies the title and the server reads the IMDb id back out of TMDB's metadata for the enrichment that needs one, though sending a concrete `imdb_id` does key the rating cache by IMDb id, sharing that row with every other client.

A build that doesn't understand `{name?}` leaves the placeholder in the URL verbatim; a literal `{tmdb_id?}` or `{imdb_id?}` is read as "no id" and the request renders from whatever else it carries, so that degrades to the same place rather than to a 400.

For a title with no IMDb id anywhere, TMDB artwork, logos, MDBList ratings, awards, sashes, genres and release status all work normally. Only the IMDb-keyed extras are unavailable: Metahub logo fallback, digital-release detection, and automatic stream-quality badges (an explicit `quality=` still works, which is why the Plex and Jellyfin sync scripts keep full badges either way).

### Without a TMDB key

A TMDB key is still the recommended setup — it is where textless posters, poster/logo language selection, the TMDB-keyed sashes (trending, release status) and TMDB's own rating come from. But an instance with no key on the server and none on the request can still render any title it has an IMDb id for, from Stremio's Cinemeta catalogue (`CINEMETA_ENABLED`, on by default): its Metahub background is cropped to portrait with the logo composited on top, exactly like a TMDB backdrop; `textless=false` serves its official one-sheet; landscape uses the background as shot. Title, year, genre, runtime, status, dates, episodes, cast and director come from the same document, so the genre canvas, the info sash, the director/cast sashes, movie release status (from Cinemeta's theatrical and disc dates and MDBList's digital date), the TV lifecycle and structure sashes (Airing / Ended / Cancelled, Mini Series, Binge Ready, New Season, Returning) and the Globe / Emmy / festival top-prize sashes (keyed on the TMDB id Cinemeta carries) all work; MDBList ratings, awards, keywords and quality badges are IMDb-keyed and unaffected. What a missing key does cost: no TMDB key loses the studio sash and the foreign-language sash, and without MDBList as well a movie's digital release is assumed after `CINEMA_ASSUMED_DIGITAL_DAYS` (60) unless the movieleaks feed has seen it sooner; no MDBList key loses the Oscar, cult, true-story and Metacritic sashes, the age rating, and the score unless `imdb_rating_source` / `tmdb_rating_source` supply one. Cinemeta also carries TMDB's id for most titles, which is what resolves an `imdb_id`-only request without a key. The configurator's search works without a key too: it searches Cinemeta's catalogue, picks titles by IMDb id, resolves the TMDB id from Cinemeta on selection, and previews from the IMDb id alone when there is none. A verbatim `{tmdb_id}` / `{tmdb_id?}` placeholder on a request is read as "no TMDB id", like the `imdb_id` one, so a client that has no TMDB id for a title and sends its IMDb id still renders.

The same path is taken when a key *is* configured but TMDB has no record for the IMDb id, and Cinemeta's art is tried as a last tier before the genre canvas when TMDB knows a title but has no artwork. A `tmdb_id`-only request without a key cannot be served — Cinemeta is IMDb-keyed — and is refused with a 400 saying so. The configurator's search and preview still need a TMDB key.

Append `&debug=1` to any poster URL to receive a JSON response with all computed metadata (score, genre, sash label, quality tokens, award data, matched cast/directors) instead of rendering the image. Useful for diagnosing unexpected sashes or missing ratings.

Append `&nocache=1` (requires `ACCESS_KEY` to be set and valid) to force a fresh render of a single title, bypassing the composite cache read and re-caching the result. Lets you refresh one poster without flushing the whole cache.

### Landscape posters

Pass `shape=landscape` for the dedicated 16:9 renderer:

```
https://yourdomain.com/poster?tmdb_id={tmdb_id}&type={type}&shape=landscape
```

`shape` also accepts `poster` as a synonym for `portrait`, which is the word Nuvio's `{shape}` placeholder substitutes; an absent, unrecognised or unsubstituted value renders portrait, and all of those spellings share one cached composite. The one value that is refused is `square`: there is no square renderer, and coercing it would push a 2:3 poster into a 1:1 tile, so it answers `400` and Nuvio's fallback keeps the addon's own artwork for those items.

Landscape mode uses backdrop artwork, keeps the top corners clear for client overlays, and combines the genre, year, rating, sash, and age rating into one bottom information band. Typography, spacing, and overlays are sized relative to the canvas height for consistent proportions.

Optional parameters control the landscape-specific choices:

- `landscape_art=textless|original` selects a language-neutral backdrop with a composited logo (the default) or the highest-ranked language-tagged backdrop with its own title treatment.
- `badge_pos=top_left|top_right|bottom_left|bottom_right|logo` places the info badge in a corner or with the composited logo (above it in the bottom row, below it at the top). A badge that would land on the logo or the info line moves off it, away from its edge.
- Landscape defaults differ from portrait for the shared vignette settings: a bare `shape=landscape` URL renders with `vignette_poster_color_bottom=true`, two-tone on, local blending off, saturation 2.0, lightness 1.3, blur 1.0 and `landscape_color_link=badge_follows_vignette`. Pass any of them explicitly to override.
- `landscape_badge_scale=0.5–2.5` scales the info badge (type and padding together); `1.0` is the tuned size.
- `landscape_info_scale=0.5–2.0` scales the `Genre • Year • Score` line in the bottom-right corner; `1.0` is the tuned size. It grows up and to the left, and drops the genre first if it would reach the logo.
- `landscape_logo_pos` (default `left`) moves the logo, or the title standing in for one. `left`, `center` and `right` keep it in the bottom row: the `Genre • Year • Score` line takes the other side, or sits centred under a centred logo, which stands on it. `top_left`, `top_center` and `top_right` hang it from the top, a little smaller, and leave the bottom row to the `Genre • Year • Score` line on the logo's side. A corner badge (`badge_pos=top_left` / `top_right`) that the top logo is in the way of moves down under it. `badge_pos=logo` follows the logo: above it in the bottom row, below it at the top.
- `landscape_info_pos` places the `Genre • Year • Score` line: `auto` (the default) puts it against the logo as described above, and `bottom_left`, `bottom_center`, `bottom_right`, `top_left`, `top_center` and `top_right` give it a spot of its own. In the logo's own spot the two stack: the logo stands on the line in the bottom row, and the line hangs under the logo at the top. Beside a logo in the same row, the line drops its genre, then its year, rather than run into it.
- `landscape_vignette_top=true` adds a band across the top in the same poster colour as the bottom band, using the same colour settings, to back a top logo or the top-corner badge. Off by default. There is no plain black top band on landscape.
- `landscape_badge_display_mode=7` turns on Graphic Badges for landscape, with its own groups `landscape_badge_group1`–`4` (each falls back to the plain `badge_group1`–`4`, then the default). Off by default, and the portrait's `badge_display_mode` never turns it on, so one `shape={shape}` URL can have badges on one layout and not the other. The top rows sit on the info badge's line, and `chip` takes the top corner that badge leaves free. Every row moves away from its corner until it clears what is already drawn. No other badge mode draws on landscape.
- `landscape_score_out_of_10=true` prints that line's score out of 10 with one decimal (`8.7`, `8.0`), and `10` for a perfect score. Off by default (`87`).
- `landscape_score_star=true` puts a star beside that line's score, as Clean mode does on a portrait: `Genre • Year ★ 87` in place of `Genre • Year • 87`. Off by default.
- `landscape_art_source=tmdb|tvdb` (default `tmdb`) takes the backdrop from TVDB: with `landscape_art=textless` its best background with no language (TVDB's clean art), with `original` its best background in the request's language order, passing over ones TVDB marks as carrying no text. Titles TVDB has nothing for keep TMDB's backdrop. Offered when the operator turns on `TVDB_POSTER_SOURCE`, and read as `tmdb` otherwise.
- `landscape_greyscale=true` greyscales the art while a film is still in cinemas or not out yet, as `cinema_greyscale` does on a portrait, but without needing the release-status sash. The bands go black, the colour they keep on a greyscaled portrait. `cinema_greyscale_skip_if_available` applies, and so does `greyscale_no_quality` on a landscape that shows quality.
- `landscape_badge_style=glass|black|silver|gold` (default `glass`, the frosted pill) draws the info badge in one of the portrait notch's dark styles: a near-black pill, or a dark one with a silver or gold rim. `landscape_badge_text_color=RRGGBB` sets the dark pills' label colour.
- `landscape_winner_star=true` puts a ★ in front of an award winner's badge label, as `sash_winner_star` does on a portrait.
- `landscape_logo_scale=0.5–1.5` (default `1.0`) scales the box the logo, or the title standing in for one, is fitted to.
- `landscape_rating_badges=true` shows the `rating_badges` sites' own scores, each behind its logo, in place of the score on the info line, with `rating_badge_max`, `rating_badge_scale`, `rating_badge_style` and the per-kind sites as on a portrait (`landscape_score_out_of_10` sets the P+ scale's form). Short of room the genre drops first, then the year, then badges from the end.
- `landscape_color_link=off|badge_follows_vignette|vignette_follows_badge` links the colour of the info badge and a tinted band (`vignette_poster_color_bottom=true`): the badge takes the band's colour, or the band takes the whole-frame colour the badge uses. Only the hue is shared — the band still darkens it, the badge still lifts it for legibility.
- `landscape_<name>` sets a landscape-only value for a setting both shapes read: `vignette_poster_color_bottom`, `vignette_color_ramp`, `vignette_color_local`, `vignette_color_style`, `vignette_color_saturation`, `vignette_color_lightness`, `vignette_color_blur`, `hide_genre`, `hide_year`, `hide_rating`, `textless` and `sash_mode`. A landscape render reads `landscape_<name>`, then `<name>`, then its own default, and a portrait render never reads it — which is what lets one `shape={shape}` URL give each layout different values.

The configurator previews both shapes: the landscape button in the preview header switches the live preview to the 16:9 render, shows the landscape choices in the tabs the portrait ones live in: Logo (art and its source, textless, logo position and size), Rating (the info line's size, score out of 10, star, rating badges, and the Hide switches), Sash → Badge (position, size, colour link, style, winner star, greyscale) and Quality (Graphic Badges), and makes **Copy config** copy the landscape URL, so a client with a landscape slot can be given the same settings as the portrait one. (Only Discover+ needs it — the shared URL carries `shape={shape}` and is already both, so there is no separate landscape copy to take.) The landscape URL carries only the settings the landscape renderer reads (identity, language, sash priority and release-status filters, weights, Hide Genre, Hide Year, Hide Rating, Textless, and the bottom vignette colour with its sliders). Portrait-only controls are hidden while it is showing, and the Quality tab offers just Hidden or Graphic Badges, with its own groups for landscape. Your portrait settings are kept — switching back restores them.

Landscape renders skip stream-quality fetching unless their Graphic Badges show a quality badge.

### Poster resolution

`resolution` sets the width of a portrait poster, always 2:3: `500` (the default, 500×750), `780` (780×1170, from TMDB's `w780` art), or `1000`, `1500` or `2000`, drawn from the original art (usually 2000×3000) shrunk to fit. Backdrop crops and title logos come from the originals at every size above 500. The layout is the same at any size: fixed-pixel settings such as `badge_height`, `badge_gap` and `score_glow_blur` are still given for the 500-wide canvas and scale with it. `high` and `hd` are accepted for `780`; any other value, and every landscape render, stays at 500×750.

Measured against 500, a render costs about 2× the CPU and file size at 780, 3× at 1000, 7× at 1500 and 12× at 2000, and a 2000 render needs well over a gigabyte of memory at its peak — the larger sizes are for trying out.

The first request for each title at a new size fetches its larger art once. A larger size only shows where a client draws the poster more than ~500 physical pixels wide — a detail or hero view, a tablet, a large poster on a high-density phone; a TV grid tile is usually far smaller, so the extra detail is scaled away. Each size is cached separately, and URLs without the parameter keep their existing cached composites.

### Logo endpoint

`/logo` returns the best available title logo as its original PNG, using the same cached TMDB/Metahub selection chain as poster rendering:

```
https://yourdomain.com/logo?tmdb_id={tmdb_id}&type={type}&lang=en
```

Either id identifies the title, as on `/poster`. With both, `imdb_id` enables the Metahub fallback when TMDB metadata cannot supply one; without a TMDB key, Metahub is the only logo source. `access_key` and `tmdb_key` follow the same rules as `/poster`.

### Anime IDs (AniList / Kitsu / MyAnimeList)

Advanced metadata providers such as AIOMetadata can pass an anime-native id instead of `tmdb_id`/`imdb_id`, in which case the cover art, title, genres, air dates, status and community score all come from that provider:

```
https://yourdomain.com/poster?anilist_id={anilist_id}&type=series
https://yourdomain.com/poster?kitsu_id={kitsu_id}&type=series
```

A **MyAnimeList** id works too — `mal_id={mal_id}`, or `mal:1535` in `stremio_id` — but MAL's API needs auth, so it is never the art source: PostersPlus looks it up in the community mapping ([Fribb's anime-lists](https://github.com/Fribb/anime-lists), the same one AIOMetadata uses) and renders the Kitsu entry it maps to, or the AniList one when there's no Kitsu id. A MAL id the list doesn't know renders like any non-anime id. This needs `ANIME_ID_MAP_ENABLED` (on by default). When a Kitsu or AniList id is sent too, that one wins.

If your client can't supply one of these ids, don't use these parameters — simpler providers group anime under TV series with `tmdb_id`/`imdb_id` and keep working exactly as before. Both bare (`12345`) and Stremio-prefixed (`kitsu:12345`) forms are accepted. When both params are supplied, AniList wins.

There is nothing to switch on: the configurator's [client templates](#client-templates) append the placeholder for the clients that can resolve an anime id and leave it off for the ones that can't.

```
?tmdb_id={tmdb_id?}&imdb_id={imdb_id?}&stremio_id={id}&type={type}
```

`{id}` is the raw Stremio / Nuvio meta id — `kitsu:7442` for a Kitsu-catalogue anime, `mal:1535` for a MyAnimeList one, `tt0903747` or `tmdb:1396` otherwise. PostersPlus reads the namespace off it and ignores anything that isn't an anime id, so the same URL serves your whole library. When it holds an IMDb id, that is also used as the title's identity, which shares its rating cache row with clients that send `imdb_id` directly.

Why `{id}` rather than `{kitsu_id}`: the per-namespace placeholder is empty for every live-action title, and an empty *required* placeholder makes the resolver abandon the whole URL — so it would have to be the optional `{kitsu_id?}` form, which Discover+ can't serve. `{id}` is a plain placeholder, present in every build, and always populated, so it can never null the URL.

`anilist_id=` and `kitsu_id=` are still accepted for URLs generated before this, and both bare (`12345`) and prefixed (`kitsu:12345`) forms work.

What changes on this path:

- **Art** is the provider's single cover image. Burned-in-text scanning and backdrop rescue stay off for these covers, but when the request also carries a TMDB id, PostersPlus fetches its language-aware logo list and composites the best match by default. If the anime provider is unavailable or misses a title, a supplied TMDB id temporarily falls back to normal TMDB art without caching the degraded result. Anime cover art is ~0.72 aspect against the 500×750 canvas, so roughly 8% is cropped from the sides. Kitsu's `original` images are ~920×1270 and downscale cleanly; AniList's are ~460×636 and are upscaled slightly, so **prefer `kitsu_id` when your client has both**.
- **Ratings** include the provider score from the same response as the art, at no extra request. When an IMDb id is also supplied, that score joins the normal MDBList provider set instead of replacing it. Give the `anilist` or `kitsu` source a non-zero weight to use it. Note both score high and compressed (anime clusters ~65–80, and a poor show still scores mid-50s), so blend deliberately rather than matching your Letterboxd weight.
- **Quality badges** keep working — Torrentio, Comet, AIOStreams, and compatible QualiCache sources accept anime-native stream ids, so the id passes straight through when no IMDb id exists.
- **Sashes and enrichment** use any accompanying IMDb/TMDB ids for awards, trending, age ratings, logos, and release data. Without those ids, provider-only requests are limited to lifecycle status such as airing, ended, or cancelled.

If you only want MyAnimeList *scores* on anime that already has an IMDb id, you don't need any of this — MDBList already returns a `myanimelist` rating, so just give that source a non-zero weight.

### Operator endpoints

These are gated behind `access_key` when one is configured:

- `GET /stats`: cache row counts / sizes plus live runtime state (in-flight renders, background fetches, MDBList key cooldowns). Handy for spotting issues before they surface.
- `GET /debug/fallback-gallery`: a gallery of every genre's no-art fallback card (mascot + genre font), also reachable via the **Preview fallback art** button in the configurator's Logo section.
- `GET /admin/api/status`, `GET`/`PUT /admin/api/settings`, `POST /admin/api/restart`: the [admin dashboard](README.md#admin-dashboard)'s API, gated by `ADMIN_KEY` (header `X-Admin-Key`), not `access_key`.
- `GET /admin/api/watchlist`: the [watchlist marker](CONFIGURATION.md#watchlist-marker)'s snapshot state and, for SIMKL, whether the account is linked and any link code awaiting approval. `POST /admin/api/watchlist/simkl/link` issues a code now rather than on the loop's hourly re-prompt; `POST /admin/api/watchlist/simkl/unlink` forgets the account (revoking a V2 grant at SIMKL), drops the snapshot and re-renders the posters that carried the sash. All three back the dashboard's SIMKL panel and take the admin key like the rest.

## Award Sashes

Sashes display contextual metadata about a title - awards, festival recognition, notable cast or crew, and more. The first matching sash in the priority list is shown.

| Sash | Triggers on |
|---|---|
| Watchlist | The title is in the instance's configured watchlist (`WATCHLIST_SOURCE`, self-hosted only). First in the default order — inert on instances without one |
| Oscar Winner, Emmy Winner | Oscar Best Picture winner, Emmy Outstanding Drama/Comedy/Limited winner |
| Globe Winner | Golden Globe winner (film drama/comedy, TV drama/comedy/limited) |
| Festival Prize | The top prize by name (Palme d'Or, Golden Lion, Golden Bear, Golden Leopard, Sundance GJ), or "Cannes Winner"-style wording for any other prize at those five festivals |
| Oscar Nominee, Emmy Nominee | Oscar Best Picture nominee, Emmy Outstanding nominee |
| Globe Nominee | Golden Globe nominee (same categories as above) |
| Notable Studio | A24, Neon, Pixar, and other curated studios |
| Notable Director | Curated list of notable directors |
| Notable Cast | Curated list of notable cast members |
| Trending | Rank 1–`TRENDING_FETCH_COUNT` (default top 40) in TMDB's list or the configured movie/TV trending source; AniList's list for an AniList id when the [trending catalogs addon](CONFIGURATION.md#trending-catalogs-addon) is on |
| New Season | TV show with a recent or upcoming S2+ season premiere |
| Returning | TV show with a recent or upcoming non-premiere episode |
| Premiere | Show initial release within the last two weeks |
| Just Added | Movie with a recent TMDB digital/TV release date |
| Season Finale | Recently completed final TV season |
| Cult Classic | Curated list of cult classics |
| Foreign Language | Non-English language title |
| Newly Streaming | Legacy combined recency signal |
| Metacritic Must-See | High Metacritic score |
| True Story | Based on a true story |
| Short / Mini / Binge | Short film, miniseries, or bingeable series |
| Trending (Broad) | Lower-ranked trending titles, rank `TRENDING_FETCH_COUNT`+1–`TRENDING_BROAD_FETCH_COUNT` (default 41–100) |
| Release Status | Title's current release state: Cinema / Streaming / Physical / Production for movies, Airing / Renewed / Ended / Cancelled / Production for TV. Airing means episodes are actually going out (one aired in the last fortnight, or the next is due within one); a show between seasons is Renewed when TMDB lists its next season, and shows no status when nothing is announced. With dates on, a series is dated the same way a movie is: `Dec 25 Premiere` for an unaired show, `Mar 4 Season 3` for a dated next season, `Jan 8 Returns` after a mid-season break. Lowest default priority; movies require an extra TMDB API call the first time. When TMDB has dated an unreleased movie, the sash shows the date and what it opens instead — `Oct 16 Cinema`, `Oct 23 Streaming`, or `Dec 2027 Cinema` a year or more out (in cinemas: the next digital/disc date; in production: the first release anywhere). A show TMDB calls Ended or Cancelled is checked against TVDB (with a TVDB key): when TVDB lists a season past TMDB's last and has a future or recent episode, it reads Renewed (`Oct 20 Season 2`) or Airing instead, as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners did while TMDB still had it as a one-season miniseries. `release_status_dates=false` keeps the bare status |

Sash priority order is configurable in the web configurator via drag-and-drop. The Primary Client selector sets the edge insets for everything drawn on the poster's top or bottom edge: Stremio TV, Nuvio, Plex, and Jellyfin use `0` for both; Stremio Desktop/Web use `0.007` at the bottom (the rating bar) and `0.004` at the top (the notch, and the trending ribbon, which grows upwards by that much). The configurator has no sliders for them, but a URL can still override the top with `sash_badge_inset` and the bottom with `bar_bottom_inset`, and the configurator keeps either when it imports a URL carrying one. Individual sashes can be disabled entirely with the ✕ button - disabled sashes are serialised as `-slot_name` in the URL (e.g. `&sash_priority=wins,cast,-trending`).

`sash_priority` also accepts a shorter *diff* form, written against the default order and marked by a leading `default` token: `-slot` removes a sash and `slot@N` moves one to position N (0-based). `&sash_priority=default,-cult,festival@0` promotes the festival sash and drops the cult one, in place of naming all thirty slots. The configurator emits whichever form is shorter, and the full list keeps working exactly as before - including an all-exclusions value, which still means every sash off rather than the default order minus those.

In Notch mode, the label is sized from the notch height, so `sash_badge_size_h` (Height) scales the text along with the badge. To tighten the empty space above and below the label *without* resizing it, use `sash_badge_pad` (Padding, default `1.0`, range `0.5`–`1.5`) — it trims only the vertical padding and leaves both the font and the badge width untouched. `sash_badge_inset` is a different control again: it shifts the whole notch up or down rather than reshaping it. Padding stops shrinking once the label's line height is reached, so low values crop the gap, never the glyphs.

The frosted notch can also sit to one side with `sash_badge_pos` (default `center`): `left`/`right` float a rounded chip in from that top corner, sized to the label instead of the notch's minimum width. `sash_chip_y` (Vertical Position, default `0`, range `-0.02`–`0.15`, a share of the poster's height) moves the chip down from the corner, and top badge groups beside it follow; `sash_chip_x` (Horizontal Position, default `0`, range `-0.045`–`0.25`, a share of the poster's width) moves it in from its corner towards the middle, or out to the edge below zero, and badge groups beside it make room. On `auto` both apply only to posters where the chip goes to the side, never to a centred notch. `sash_badge_inset` still adds to it. `auto` (with `badge_display_mode=7`) decides per poster: when a title has graphic badges along the top it moves the chip beside them — to the right of a top-left group, to the left of a top-right or `chip` group, which then takes the right — and when it has none there it stays a centred notch, so a poster without badges doesn't look empty on one side. Beside an auto chip, a `chip` group is spread over the space the chip leaves: equal gaps from the chip to each badge, the last on the margin, so the spacing follows the chip's width; the group's spacing is then the least gap allowed. `auto_hug` places the notch the same way but starts that group right against the chip, at its own spacing, growing outwards — the far corner stays clear for the watched and watchlist marks some clients draw there. With groups in both top corners it stays centred. With the notch on the left, the quality/age badges (every `badge_display_mode` except hidden) move to the same spot on the right. Other notch styles always draw centred. `edge_left` / `edge_right` hang the notch off that side edge of the poster instead, in any style, its label turned to run along the edge (bottom to top on the left, top to bottom on the right); `sash_edge_y` (0.05–0.95, default 0.5) is where its middle sits down the poster. An edge notch leaves both top corners free, so a trending rank on the opposite side doesn't move it, and top badge groups keep the side chip's line.

`sash_badge_opacity=0.0–1.0` sets how solid the black, silver and gold notch bodies are (the label and trim are unchanged). `0.90` is how they have always drawn and is the default; `1.0` is solid. The frosted notch has its own `sash_badge_frost_opacity`.

`quality_after_digital=true` ignores the stream quality a film turns up with before its digital release, in every badge mode and on both shapes: until then a `4K` or `WEB-DL` is a cam or a mislabel. A film counts as out once TMDB's digital or disc date has passed, or an r/movieleaks post confirms it (the release-status sash's own rule, no sash needed); before that it is drawn as if no quality was found, so `greyscale_no_quality` can greyscale it and `cinema_greyscale_skip_if_available` has nothing to go on. A series counts as out once its first episode has aired: before that its quality is ignored the same way, while a show between seasons keeps it, even when TMDB still calls it In Production. Off by default.

`badge_display_mode=7` (**Graphic Badges**) draws Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos (one combined *Dolby / VISION • ATMOS* mark when both are in the same group), DTS:X (drawn as the "dts" letters alone, so it holds the row's height without outweighing it; plain DTS is never shown), HDR10/HDR10+, resolution (`4K` / `HD`) and the US certificate (`PG-13`, `TV-MA`, ...) in up to four groups, `badge_group1` to `badge_group4`. Each is `anchor:max:badges[:size[:spacing]]`. The anchor is `chip` (the top corner the notch or sash leaves free, on the side chip's line), `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br`, `above_logo` / `below_logo` (centred on the title logo or fallback title text, just above or below wherever it landed, so it follows each logo's height; moved further off if the rating is in the way, and bottom centre on posters with no logo drawn), or a custom position `x,y,align` in fractions of the poster (e.g. `badge_group2=0.955,0.14,r:2:res,cert`); max is 1–4; badges are any of `video`, `audio`, `res`, `cert`, `network`, `studio`, `cinema` in the order they should appear. `cinema` is a small disc on a film that is still only in cinemas, or not out anywhere yet — the same Cinema / Production status the release-status sash uses, without needing that sash or a slot in `sash_priority` (a leak confirmed by r/movieleaks takes it off, as it does the sash). It shows the day the film reaches home, its first future digital or disc date, as the month over the day (`OCT` / `16`); with no such date, a popcorn bucket for a film in cinemas or a clapperboard for one still in production. A series gets it only while it has yet to air: its premiere date, or the clapperboard when none is set. A renewed or returning series doesn't, as the disc can't say which kind of date it is. `badge_cinema_style` is its look: `auto` (default) takes its tone from the art it sits on, a white-to-silver disc over dark art and black-to-grey over light; `frosted` is the frosted notch's glass, the poster blurred under its tint. The popcorn badge's old colours (`timing`, `red`, `black`, `white`) are read as `auto`. `badge_quality_style` is the quality badges' look, on both shapes: `solid` (default) draws the filled `4K` / `HD` / `HDR` boxes and the bare Dolby and DTS:X marks; `frosted` puts each on a chip of the frosted notch's glass, the poster blurred under its tint, with the mark or label in the tint's ink. `network` is a TV show's network logo (Netflix, HBO, Apple TV, BBC One, ...), or for a film made by a streamer's own studio (Netflix, Apple Studios, Amazon MGM Studios, HBO Films) that streamer's; films a streamer only distributed aren't marked, as TMDB lists only production companies. `studio` is the first of the title's production companies on a curated list of ones people know and whose logos read at badge size (Pixar, A24, NEON, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, Blumhouse, Illumination, LAIKA, Searchlight, Focus Features, Universal, Warner Bros., Legendary and more); other companies are never shown. Both are TMDB's logos drawn as white marks, downloaded once and kept in `/app/cache/company_logos`. Size is the group's row height (10–60, default 20, which matches the chip) and spacing the space between its badges as a fraction of the poster's width (0–0.08, default 0.028), e.g. `bl:2:res,cert:28:0.02`; both are left out at their defaults. The default is `badge_group1=chip:4:video,audio,res,cert` and no other groups, and a badge listed in more than one group stays in the first. Groups are placed in order, each seeing the ones before it, so two aimed at the same corner stack rather than overlap. Top groups sit on the chip's line (the notch's own line when it is centred), bottom groups on the bottom margin — level with Minimalist's text. Each group looks at what the logo, rating, sash and the earlier groups actually drew and uses the space that is left: where its corner is taken (the frosted bar, Minimalist's Split layout, a diagonal sash, the chip itself) it slides away from the edge until its first badge fits, and badges that still don't fit beside it drop from the end of its list. A custom position is for dodging something the canvas can't see, such as a badge your client draws over the poster, so it stays exactly where it is put: `y` is the row's centre line, and `align` says which part of the row sits at `x`: `l` its left edge (the row grows rightwards), `c` its centre, `r` its right edge (grows leftwards). That edge stays put however many badges a title has. Without an `align`, the nearer edge of the poster decides. Only badges that would run off the poster are dropped. `badge_min_score` gates the quality marks but not the certificate, network or studio. Only a layout with a quality badge (`video`, `audio` or `res`) in some group asks the quality source for anything: with just the certificate, network and studio there is no quality fetch, `wait_for_quality` doesn't hold the poster back, `greyscale_no_quality` doesn't apply, and no quality source needs to be configured; `badge_height` isn't used in this mode, each group having its own size. The certificate, network and production companies come from one TMDB call per title per month (its details, with the US release dates or content ratings appended); the certificate falls back to MDBList's age (`14+`) when TMDB has none. The Dolby and DTS:X marks are fetched once from Wikimedia Commons, pinned by SHA-1, and kept in `/app/cache/commons`; until they are there, or if Commons serves a different file, those marks are simply left out.

## Ratings

Scores from multiple providers are normalised to a 0–100 scale and combined using configurable weights. Default weights use Letterboxd with Trakt fallback for movies, and Trakt (80%) and Rotten Tomatoes (20%) for TV. Weights are fully adjustable in the web configurator.

Weights renormalise over the sources actually present for a title, so a source with no score contributes nothing rather than dragging the average down. That makes the anime-only sources safe to weight: `myanimelist` (via MDBList, for anything with an IMDb id) and `anilist` / `kitsu` are inert on everything else. All three default to a weight of `0`.

AniList and Kitsu scores come from those sites, not MDBList. A title requested by [anime id](#anime-ids-anilist--kitsu) has its own site's score. Any other anime title, and the other site for an anime-id request, is matched to both sites through the anime id list (`ANIME_ID_MAP_ENABLED`): its TMDB or IMDb id finds each site's entry, and a series with several seasons uses the first. The scores are fetched only when a weight or a [rating badge](#rating-badges) uses them, and cached with the anime metadata.

### Anime Weights

Anime can score with its own weights. `anime_movie_weights` and `anime_tv_weights` take the same `source:weight` list as `movie_weights` / `tv_weights`, and apply to any title that has a `myanimelist`, `anilist` or `kitsu` rating — that is the whole test, no genre guesswork. MDBList returns a MyAnimeList score for the anime it knows, so a title requested by ordinary TMDB/IMDb id qualifies just as an anime-native request does.

Both parameters are opt-in. A URL that names neither scores its anime with the movie and TV weights exactly as before, so existing URLs are unaffected. In the configurator, the Weights tab's **Separate Anime Weights** toggle reveals the two groups.

The source lists are what MDBList actually returns for anime. Anime films carry every movie source. Anime series never carry a Metacritic critic score or a Roger Ebert review, so `anime_tv_weights` does not offer them; Letterboxd, which `tv_weights` omits, does appear for about half of anime series and is offered.

| Parameter | Sources |
|---|---|
| `anime_movie_weights` | `myanimelist`, `anilist`, `kitsu`, `letterboxd`, `trakt`, `tomatoes`, `popcorn`, `imdb`, `metacritic`, `metacriticuser`, `tmdb`, `rogerebert` |
| `anime_tv_weights` | `myanimelist`, `anilist`, `kitsu`, `trakt`, `tomatoes`, `popcorn`, `imdb`, `metacriticuser`, `tmdb`, `letterboxd` |

`debug=1` reports `is_anime` and the `rating_weights` a title was scored with.

### Rating Badges

`rating_badges` shows individual sites' scores, each behind that site's logo, in place of the ★ and the weighted score: after the genre in Clean (`rating_display_mode=2`), before each score in Minimalist (`3`), and after the year and genre in the Bar (`4`), in place of its "★ score". It takes a comma list in display order, up to 6, from `pplus` (the weighted score itself, under the Posters+ mark), `imdb`, `tomatoes`, `popcorn`, `metacritic`, `metacriticuser`, `letterboxd`, `trakt`, `tmdb`, `rogerebert`, `myanimelist`, `anilist` and `kitsu`: for example `rating_badges=imdb,tomatoes`.

- `rating_badge_max=1–5` draws at most that many: the first ones down the list that the title has a score from, so the sites further down stand in when one is missing (`rating_badges=imdb,letterboxd,tomatoes&rating_badge_max=1` shows IMDb, or Letterboxd where there is no IMDb score). Without it, as many as fit are drawn.
- A site can be limited to some kinds of title by adding `:` and any of `m` (movies), `t` (TV) and `a` (anime): `rating_badges=imdb:mt,tomatoes,myanimelist:a` shows IMDb on movies and TV, MyAnimeList on anime only, and Rotten Tomatoes on everything. A title counts as anime when it was requested by anime id or has a score from an anime site, the same rule the anime weights use.

- A site the title has no score from is skipped. A title with a score from none of them keeps the weighted score.
- Only as many as fit on the line are drawn, first ones first. The rest of the label keeps its room and the badges get what is left: Clean's large type usually fits one or two beside the genre, and the Bar two or three after the year and genre (more with Hide Year or Hide Genre). With nothing else on the Bar, the badges are spread evenly across it.
- Rotten Tomatoes shows a fresh tomato or a splat, and the Popcornmeter an upright or spilled bucket, split at 60% as on the site. Roger Ebert, which publishes no logo, is a thumbs-up.
- `rating_badge_style=mono` draws every badge in the colour of the text beside it, as a solid shape with the logo cut out (Rotten Tomatoes as a tomato with "RT" cut out of it), so a tinted vignette can't clash with a logo's colours. The default `color` keeps each site's own.
- `rating_badge_scale=native` (default) prints each score the way the site does (`7.8`, `92%`, `3.9`). `normalized` puts them on the weighted score's scale, following the mode's out-of-10 switch.
- The Rating Bar (`1`), Minimalist's Year layout and the Bar's year-only or sash labels (`bar_append=year` / `sash`) print no score, so they draw no badges. Neither does landscape, nor a hidden rating.

`meta_order` sets the order genre, year and rating print in, as all three names comma-separated (`year,genre,rating`), in every mode and shape that prints more than one of them; a field a mode doesn't print is skipped, and without it each mode keeps its own order. A score that comes first carries its own ★ where its style uses one. In Minimalist's Split layout the score keeps its own margin: the right one, or the left when it comes first. Rating badges follow the score's place.

The logos are downloaded once per instance and none ship with PostersPlus. See the [README](README.md#license) for sources.

## Poster Translations

Text rendered onto posters (genre labels and info-sash labels) can be localised. The language follows the request's **poster/logo language** setting.

`original_labels` gives a title's labels in its own language instead: a comma list of original languages (`original_labels=ar` or `ar,he`), and a title first made in one of them has its genre and sash labels translated into that language, and a text title standing in for its logo drawn as its original title (when a label font has its letters). Every other title keeps the request's language. A language with no file here is left as it is. Off (blank) by default.

Right-to-left labels (Hebrew, Arabic) are reordered with the Unicode bidi algorithm, and Arabic letters are first joined into the forms they take in a word (initial, medial, final, the lam-alef ligature), as neither Pillow without libraqm nor Skia's `drawString` shapes text. The joined forms are the Arabic Presentation Forms, which many Arabic fonts reach only through OpenType features: fontprep's `add_arabic_presentation_forms` maps them from those features for the shipped fonts and for uploaded ones.

A language file may give its own digits as `"digits"` (ten characters, zero first; `ar.json` has `"٠١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩"`). They are used for the trending rank, release dates, season numbers and the year; scores, ratings and names such as "A24" keep 0-9.

To add a language, copy `languages/en.json` to `languages/<code>.json` (e.g. `fr.json`) and translate the **values** only; the keys are the canonical English strings and must stay unchanged. Translation is display-only with per-key English fallback: any missing key, malformed file, or language with no JSON falls back to English, so partial translations are safe.

Region-qualified files (`pt-br.json`) are supported and take precedence over the bare language (`pt.json`) for a `pt-br` request. Note that this differs from how region-qualified **artwork** is selected: a region file wins per *table*, not per *key*, so a `pt-br.json` that ships a partial `sashLabels` map does **not** borrow the missing entries from `pt.json` — they fall through to English. Region files should be full copies of `en.json`, not diffs.

`label_font` picks the font poster text is drawn in: `inter` (default), `rubik`, `jakarta` (Plus Jakarta Sans), `manrope`, `montserrat`, `robotocondensed`, `barlowcondensed`, `oswald`, `spacegrotesk`, `exo2`, `fira` (Fira Sans), `opensans`, `almarai` or `tajawal`. An operator can upload more in the dashboard (Fonts); those take a `custom-…` key, shown there, and a key the instance doesn't have draws in Inter. It covers the genre / year / rating line, the sash and notch, the Bar, the trending ribbon's caption and the landscape labels; quality and age badges and the trending numeral stay in Inter. A language the chosen font has no glyphs for is drawn in the first font that has them, so Hebrew is always drawn in Rubik, Arabic in Almarai (or Tajawal when it is chosen), and Greek or Vietnamese always in Inter. A text title standing in for a missing logo does the same when its genre font can't draw it.

> Note: between them the label fonts cover **Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Arabic**. Right-to-left text is reordered line by line with the Unicode bidi algorithm, and Arabic is the one joining script shaped (see above); there are no CJK, Indic or Thai glyphs, so those will not render correctly. `tests/test_i18n_sash_vocabulary.py` fails on any character no label font can draw.
