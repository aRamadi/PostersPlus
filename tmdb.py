    Signals (all computed on a 320 px-wide thumbnail for speed):

    1. Skin-tone mask  — HSV-based detection of warm pinkish-orange hues that
       reliably indicate human (and many animated) characters.  Strong weight
       (×4) because it's the most semantically meaningful signal for movie art.

    2. Center-surround saliency  — Difference of two Gaussian blurs at different
       radii (fine ≈ 4 % of width, coarse ≈ 20 % of width).  Finds blobs that
       are locally distinct from their surroundings — faces, figures, bright
       objects — rather than just any edge or texture.  Weight ×2.

    3. Saturation  — Subjects tend to be more saturated than blurred/desaturated
       backgrounds.  Lightweight secondary signal (×0.5).

    Vertical weighting: upper 65 % of frame gets 2× weight because characters'
    faces and torsos live in the top half; floors and landscape fill the bottom.

    Centre bias: ≈10 % of peak score — gentle enough not to override clear signal

    tier, or the film's next published release date when TMDB has told us one —
    and ``release_status_cache`` mirrors the status derived from them.
