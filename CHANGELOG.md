# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Landscape vignette levels, as on a poster

- The landscape poster's Vignette settings are now the portrait's: Top and
  Bottom levels (None, Low, Medium, High, Custom), Top and Bottom Colour
  from Poster, and Vignette Only On Sash, kept per shape. The bottom band
  can now be turned off or lightened, and either band can be plain black
  rather than tinted. Defaults render as before: bottom High and tinted,
  top off (tinted when turned on).
- New `landscape_top_gradient`, `landscape_bottom_gradient` (and their
  custom height and opacity), `landscape_vignette_poster_color_top` and
  `landscape_top_vignette_sash_only`. A landscape render reads only these,
  never the portrait's plain names, so existing landscape URLs are
  unchanged. `landscape_vignette_top=true` still works as a tinted High top.

### Landscape Badge Settings

- The landscape badge gets the portrait notch's settings that fit a pill, in
  a Badge Settings group with Badge Size: Width, Height, Font Size, Opacity
  and Colour Saturation for the glass, Opacity for the dark styles, and
  Horizontal / Vertical Position (`landscape_badge_width`, `_height`,
  `_font`, `_glass_opacity`, `_saturation`, `_opacity`, `_x`, `_y`). The
  defaults draw the badge as before.

### Extras tab: Graphic Badges only, the old badges as a Legacy slot

- The configurator's Quality tab is now Extras, and Graphic Badges are its
  only mode, behind a Show Badges switch. The older modes (Quality Notch,
  Bookmark, Badge Row, Combined Badge, Quality Age Rating, Age Rating Only)
  are the styles of a new Legacy badge (`legacy` slot,
  `badge_legacy_style`), placed by the four groups like any other badge.
- The Legacy bookmark hangs from its group's corner, a bottom one included,
  and the groups lay out around it.
- Importing a URL with an old `badge_display_mode` converts it to its
  Legacy style, alone in group 1 at the spot it was drawn. Old URLs still
  render as before on the server.

### Art source per media type, for posters and landscape, and Cinemeta

- The art source is now three dropdowns, Movie, Series and Anime, in both
  shapes: `poster_source_movie` / `_tv` / `_anime` for posters and
  `landscape_art_source_movie` / `_tv` / `_anime` for landscape. Each picks
  TMDB, Fanart, TVDB or Cinemeta, and a title the source has nothing for
  keeps its TMDB art. Anime is Japanese animation, or a title requested by
  an AniList, Kitsu or MAL id. The old `poster_source` and
  `landscape_art_source` still work and set all three (`fanart_anime` sets
  Fanart for anime only), so existing URLs render, and cache, as before.
- Cinemeta is the Metahub art Stremio shows by default (#45, thanks
  @alpinezx). Its posters all carry the title, in English, so for posters
  it is offered with Original art only; its backgrounds never do, so for
  landscape it is offered with Textless + Logo only. Needs no key; offered
  while `CINEMETA_ENABLED` is on. An OA Poster override in Admin > Artwork
  can be ticked for Cinemeta to replace a wrong Metahub poster.
- Portrait's Original Art switch is now an Art dropdown (Textless + Logo or
  Original), as landscape's is, and its Primary / Top-rated pick is labelled
  TMDB Poster. The URL parameters are unchanged.
- A Metahub image that 404s after its existence check now clears that check
  for the title's IMDb id even when the request only carried a TMDB id, so
  the next render re-checks instead of failing until the cache runs out.

### TMDB Read Access Tokens work as a key

- TMDB's settings page lists two credentials, and pasting the longer "API
  Read Access Token" (`eyJ...`) as `tmdb_key` or `TMDB_API_KEY` used to half
  work: TMDB rejects it as the `api_key` parameter, so titles already cached
  rendered while others failed with a 502 or fell back to Cinemeta (#47).
  It is now sent as a Bearer header, which TMDB accepts, everywhere a key is
  used, the configurator included.
- A `tmdb_key=` that TMDB rejects is answered with a 401 saying so, also when
  it fails on the IMDb or TVDB id lookup. That used to fall back to Cinemeta
  or TVDB without a word, so a bad key looked like poorer posters.

### Later anime seasons get their own landscape art

- In landscape, an anime's later seasons and cours no longer all share the
  show's one TMDB backdrop. A season the id mapping places after the show's
  start (or one found through its prequel) takes Kitsu's cover image of that
  season, cut to 16:9, when it is big enough and carries no title, else
  TMDB's still of the season's first episode, else the show's backdrop as
  before. Requests by AniList id borrow the Kitsu cover through the mapping.
  An operator's Artwork pick for the show still wins. `ANIME_SEASON_ART`
  (Anime sources, on by default) turns it off.
- Covers with lettering are left out by a recogniser check of their own
  (the poster text rules pass a cover whose middle is a kanji logo). It
  catches most, not all: a heavily stylised title can still get through.
- The configurator's search finds anime seasons and titles TMDB doesn't
  list. Kitsu is searched alongside TMDB (or Cinemeta): a show's later
  seasons, cours and specials appear under it ("Jujutsu Kaisen" → Season 2,
  The Culling Game), and a title TMDB lacks after TMDB's results (Detective
  Conan: The Gold-Star Answer). The preview sends the Kitsu id as Nuvio
  does, so it shows that season's own art. Season 1 of a show TMDB has isn't
  repeated, and Kitsu being down only leaves these out. Needs the anime id
  mapping.

### New anime in landscape, shared artwork, and genres hidden from trending

- Anime requested by an AniList or Kitsu id alone (as Nuvio's catalogs send
  them) no longer falls to the genre canvas in landscape when the community
  id mapping hasn't caught up with it yet. A later season takes its first
  season's TMDB and IMDb ids through AniList's prequel links (TOUGEN ANKI:
  Nikko Kegon Falls Arc, A Wild Last Boss Appeared! Season 2), and a new show
  is found on TMDB by an exact name match among animated shows that started
  within a year of it (Overgeared). That brings back the logo and ratings
  too. A title TMDB doesn't have at all (Detective Conan: The Gold-Star
  Answer) uses AniList's banner or Kitsu's cover image.
- An anime-id request now agrees with the TMDB-id request for the same
  show. It carries TMDB's IMDb id, so with no TMDB backdrop it takes
  Metahub's background like a TMDB request (not the AniList banner). When
  the id mapping names a TMDB entry TMDB has since deleted, the next request
  resolves past it by IMDb id. A TMDB-id request for anime finds its anime
  rank by the IMDb id TMDB gives too (I'm Dating a Dark Summoner showed
  "Japanese" by TMDB id and "#3 Today" by AniList id).
- AniList's rate limit no longer leaves new anime on the genre canvas for
  ten minutes after a catalog burst (GROTESQQQUE). The resolver reads the
  titles and prequel from the metadata the render already fetches instead
  of asking AniList again, every AniList call waits out its Retry-After
  instead of collecting more 429s, and a throttled lookup is retried after
  two minutes.
- `landscape_poster_crop=true` (Logo → Crop Poster When No Backdrop) cuts
  the poster to 16:9, centred on faces or else on its upper part, with the
  logo on top, for titles with no backdrop anywhere.
- Fanart works for landscape: `landscape_art_source=fanart` takes
  fanart.tv's most-liked background (textless) or a thumb in your language
  (original), and `fanart_anime` does that for anime only.
- Operators can share their Artwork view picks (`ART_OVERRIDES_SHARE`), and
  another instance can follow them (`ART_OVERRIDES_REMOTE_URL`). Its own
  picks win; shared images are copied once and checked against their hash.
- `TRENDING_HIDE_GENRES` (dashboard → Trending) leaves genres off the
  instance's trending lists before ranks are numbered, so catalog rows and
  poster ranks still match. `TRENDING_HIDE_MIXED_GENRES` decides whether a
  title only partly of a hidden genre goes too.
- `trending_side=center` (Under Notch) hangs the trending numeral under the
  notch wherever it is drawn: centred, a left or right chip, or where an
  Auto notch moved it on that poster. The ribbon hangs from the top edge, so
  it isn't offered Under Notch (a URL asking for it gets the left corner).
  `trending_align=edge` (Number under Side Notch → Outer Edge) lines the
  numeral up with a side chip's outer edge instead of centring it on the
  chip; under a centred notch it stays centred.
- Share settings leaves out what is at its default, like every other copied
  URL. It spelled every parameter out, so even an untouched configuration
  was about 2100 characters, too long for a Discord message; it is now
  about 300. Imports fill the gaps from the code's defaults, which are the
  same on every instance, so a share still imports exactly.
- Auto, Beside Notch spreads a badge row that nearly fills the space beside
  the chip out to the margin, its gaps growing up to 2.5 times the group's
  spacing; a short row still sits against the chip.

### Mini Series follows TMDB's own Miniseries type

- A show TMDB types as **Miniseries** gets the Mini Series sash whatever its
  episode count, as well as one season of up to eight episodes. Limited
  series outside the US and UK often run 10 to 15 episodes (most Arabic
  ones do) and missed it. TMDB's type is kept with the rest of a show's
  cached metadata, so a show cached before this picks it up when its
  metadata next refreshes.

### More network and studio logos, drawn at one standard size

- The studio badge knows about 37 more studios: MGM, Miramax, Lions Gate
  Films (as well as Lionsgate), Summit, Orion, TriStar, Touchstone, Village
  Roadshow, Working Title, Skydance and Skydance Animation, StudioCanal,
  Film4, MUBI, Cartoon Saloon, Studio Ponoc, Toei Animation, Kyoto
  Animation, ufotable and MAPPA; and 20th Century Fox and 20th Century
  Studios, DreamWorks Animation and DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount, New Line,
  Castle Rock, Carolco, Lightstorm, CJ Entertainment, Studio Ghibli, Bad
  Robot, Syncopy, Toho, Silver Pictures and Big Talk. A film by several of
  them shows the one earliest on the list, the bigger name, rather than the
  first TMDB credits: Die Hard shows 20th Century Fox, not Silver Pictures.
- More films get a network badge from the streamer that made them: Netflix
  Animation Studios (Netflix), Apple (Apple TV), Amazon Studios (Prime
  Video), and HBO and HBO Documentary Films (HBO).
- Network and studio logos come out at about the same visual size. They
  were sized by area but held to the row's height, so square emblems (HBO,
  A24) and very long wordmarks came out at well under half the size of
  mid-width ones, and a solid logo looked much heavier than a thin one in
  the same box. Each logo is now weighed by its ink as well as its shape and
  fits a box 3.8 rows wide by 1.15 high (was 3.5 by 1), which shrinks for a
  heavy logo, so a solid disc (abc, TNT) no longer fills the same space as
  an outline emblem (Universal, Warner Bros.). Tuned on a sheet of real
  TMDB logos.
- A solid logo's lettering is cut out by how much it stands out from the
  logo's own colour, lighter or darker, instead of by a fixed brightness. An
  orange block (Nickelodeon's splat) was drawn a third transparent, a yellow
  one lost its white lettering, and dark lettering on a light disc was never
  cut out. Only parts the block holds inside it are cut: one that reaches
  the logo's edge (Fox Kids' yellow X, HBO Max's "max") stays. And only the
  lettering's own colour, on one side of the block: SBT's colour wheel lost
  its dark purples as black patches and kept half of its white "sbt". Each
  separate shape is judged on its own, so an emblem over a wordmark (Toei's
  cat over "TOEI ANIMATION") keeps its face instead of becoming a blob.
- Fox Kids is drawn with FOX's logo, its own (red letters in a thick comic
  outline) not surviving as a white mark, and HBO always with its black
  logo: TMDB has given it two, and titles cached at different times showed
  either.
- New **Network / Studio Logo Size** (`badge_logo_scale=0.5–2.0`, default
  `1.0`) multiplies that standard size, on both shapes. Posters with a
  network or studio badge re-render once (render revision 29).
- A logo that doesn't fit beside what shares its line (Minimalist's genre
  and year) is drawn smaller, down to 60%, instead of the group jumping
  above the text. A long wordmark such as TOKYO MX now stays down by the
  genre and year.
- `tools/logo_sheet.py` draws every downloaded network and studio logo on
  one sheet at badge size, with the numbers the sizing works from, for
  tuning and for checking new studios read.

### Original art in the Logo Priority list

- Logo Priority has a new **Original Art** entry (`art` in `logo_priority`,
  e.g. `logo_priority=native,english,art,text`). When no source above it
  has a logo, the textless art is swapped for the title's original art
  (title baked in) instead of carrying on down the list, so drawing the
  title as text no longer has to be the fallback. Portrait takes the
  poster original-art mode would pick; landscape the text-bearing backdrop
  `landscape_art=original` would pick. A title with no original art
  carries on to the sources below it. Original-art mode stays the way to
  use original art first; this entry is for when textless doesn't work out.

### One Copy config URL for AIOMetadata, Nuvio, Bingecat and Xperience

- All four now take Nuvio's URL, with `{shape}` and the optional `{name?}`
  ids, so the **Copy config** menu is down to that URL (**Default**), **Discover+** and
  **Share settings**. A left-click copies the shared URL straight away instead
  of asking first, which stops a URL copied for one client ending up in
  another. Picking Discover+ is still remembered for the next left-click.
- AIOMetadata and Xperience URLs now carry `shape={shape}` (one URL for
  portrait and landscape) and the TMDB / MDBList keys typed into the
  configurator, as Nuvio's always did. Bingecat now gets the optional ids and
  anime ids too.

### Anime rating badges on landscape posters

- Landscape posters with rating badges (`landscape_rating_badges`) now show
  **AniList and Kitsu** scores on anime, as portrait does. Landscape decided
  whether to fetch them by portrait's rating mode, which a landscape URL
  never sends, so those badges only appeared on titles requested by that
  site's own id. Affected landscape posters re-render once.

### Films stop reading "Cinema" when TMDB never adds a digital date

- A movie whose only past release is theatrical, with no digital date
  published, now reads **Streaming after 60 days** (`CINEMA_ASSUMED_DIGITAL_DAYS`)
  with a TMDB key too, not only on the keyless Cinemeta path. Before, stale
  TMDB data could keep a film at "Cinema" for three years.
- **Popular films get a longer run**: with at least `CINEMA_POPULAR_VOTES`
  (1000) TMDB votes, a film stays "Cinema" for up to
  `CINEMA_POPULAR_DIGITAL_DAYS` (180), enough for a ~120-day blockbuster run.
- A published digital date, even a future one, still wins over either window,
  and a film assumed to be streaming keeps having its TMDB dates re-checked
  daily. `CINEMA_MAX_AGE_YEARS` (3) stays as the outer backstop.
- `TRENDING_HIDE_UNRELEASED` judges films the same way, using the vote count
  on TMDB's trending rows.

### Anime trends on its own lists, and trending can skip what isn't out

- With the trending catalogs addon on, **Japanese anime leaves Trending
  Movies and Trending Series** and ranks only on the anime lists. Every anime
  poster now shows its anime rank, whatever id it is requested by and whatever
  catalog it is in: an AniList or Kitsu (or MyAnimeList) id as that entry, a
  TMDB or IMDb id as the best rank of any of its seasons, else its TMDB rank.
  Anything on the anime lists is off the movie and series lists, so no title
  is in two rows; Chinese and Korean animation that isn't trending on AniList
  stays on the series and movie lists, where it trends. The movie and series rows (and the ranks on their posters) are
  renumbered once on update.
- A new **Trending Anime Movies** catalog ranks AniList's trending anime
  films. Re-import the addon's manifest to see it.
- `TRENDING_SOURCE_ANIME` and `TRENDING_SOURCE_ANIME_MOVIE` replace AniList's
  lists with an MDBList page or TMDB-shaped JSON, like the movie and TV
  sources.
- `TRENDING_HIDE_UNRELEASED` (off by default) leaves titles that aren't out at
  home yet off the trending lists: films still in cinemas or unreleased,
  series not yet aired, anime not yet airing, and anime films still only in
  cinemas (by their TMDB dates, as their release badge reads them). The rest are ranked without
  gaps, so the catalogs and poster ranks still agree.
- The catalogs' poster URLs name the list they were cut from (`rv=`), so a
  list rebuilt mid-day no longer leaves an app showing yesterday's ranks
  until its cached images expire. The catalogs themselves may be cached for
  10 minutes, rather than until the next refresh.
- A quality badge under a trending number or ribbon sits the same distance
  below it on every poster, instead of nearer or further depending on the art.
- Frosted quality badges and the frosted cinema disc use the frosted notch's
  opacity setting.
- Anime films requested by Kitsu, AniList or MyAnimeList id alone now find
  their TMDB entry (logo, backdrop, ratings). The id mapping lists a film's
  TMDB id as a list, which was being dropped, so no anime film had one.

### Updates keep the poster cache

- Updating PostersPlus no longer re-renders every cached poster. The cache
  key followed the language files' and genre backgrounds' timestamps, which
  every image build resets; it now follows what they contain, so posters only
  re-render when one of them actually changes. (This update itself re-renders
  once.)

### MyAnimeList ids

- Anime requested by **MyAnimeList id** now renders: `mal_id=`, or a
  `mal:1535` Stremio id in `stremio_id={id}`. MAL itself needs auth, so the
  id is looked up in the same community mapping as Kitsu/AniList ids and
  rendered as its Kitsu entry (AniList when there's no Kitsu id). A Kitsu or
  AniList id sent alongside wins; a MAL id the mapping doesn't know renders
  as before.

### Landscape catches up, and frosted quality badges

- **Frosted quality badges**: Quality Badge Style (Quality tab, Graphic
  Badges) puts 4K, HD, HDR, Dolby and DTS:X each on a chip of the frosted
  notch's glass, in portrait and landscape. `badge_quality_style=frosted`.
- **Ignore Quality Before Digital Release** (Quality tab): a film still in
  cinemas has no real digital copy, so its "4K" is a cam. Until TMDB's
  digital or disc date passes, or r/movieleaks confirms it, its quality is
  treated as not found. A series that hasn't premiered yet is treated the
  same way. `quality_after_digital=true`.
- Shows TMDB calls **Ended** but TVDB has carried on with (Cyberpunk:
  Edgerunners, still a one-season miniseries on TMDB) read Renewed, dated
  from TVDB ("Oct 20 Season 2"). Needs a TVDB key.
- **TVDB backdrops for landscape**: Art Source under the landscape Art
  choice, offered with the TVDB poster source. `landscape_art_source=tvdb`.
- Portrait settings that work at 16:9, each a landscape setting of its own
  and off until chosen: Greyscale Poster if Unavailable, the black, silver
  and gold badge styles with a text colour, Winner Star, Logo Size, and
  Rating Badges on the info line. Left on the portrait: the rating modes,
  notch geometry, diagonal sash colours, trending rank marks and the older
  quality badge modes, which are drawn for the 2:3 layout.

### Horror for TV, and Rom-Com

- TMDB has no Horror genre for TV, so American Horror Story printed Fantasy.
  Shows now get Horror from MDBList's genres, which come with the ratings
  call already made. Until MDBList has answered, and without an MDBList key,
  a "horror" TMDB keyword decides, and a show with no keywords asks Cinemeta,
  then TVDB (with a key). Cached TV metadata is fetched again once.
- New **Rom-Com** genre for titles TMDB (or AniList/Kitsu) gives both
  Comedy and Romance, ranked just above Comedy: The Love Hypothesis,
  Notting Hill and Pretty Woman print Rom-Com, and Friends (Comedy only on
  TMDB) stays Comedy. IMDb and TVDB genres don't count, since they tag
  sitcoms Romance. Rank it below Comedy and Romance in the genre order to
  turn it off. A genre order saved before Rom-Com existed gets it in front
  of Comedy.

### Logs in the dashboard

- A **Logs** view in the admin dashboard: the server log with filters for
  level, time, module, app or HTTP lines and text (exclusions, phrases,
  regex), a *Problems only* switch, a live tail and a download.
- Every line knows the request that logged it, so one matching line can
  bring the rest of its request with it, or open that request on its own.
- **Find a title** by name (or IMDb / TVDB id) to see its ids and only the
  lines about it: no more looking ids up on TMDB or IMDb to grep for them.
- `LOG_VIEWER_MAX_MB` (default 20) caps the disk it uses; 0 turns it off.

### Hebrew, and a font choice

- Poster text can be in **Hebrew** (thanks @haveAnIssue), drawn right to
  left: each line is reordered with the Unicode bidi algorithm, so numbers,
  the ★ and Latin names still read left to right inside it.
- **Font** (Presentation) picks the font poster text is drawn in: Inter, as
  before, or Rubik. A language the chosen font has no letters for is drawn
  in one that has them, so Hebrew is always Rubik. A text title standing in
  for a missing logo switches font the same way when its genre font can't
  draw it.

### Edge notch, label order, release-date badge

- The notch can hang off the **Left Edge** or **Right Edge** of the poster,
  its label running along the side, with an **Edge Position** slider to move
  it up and down.
- **Labels → Order** sets the order genre, year and rating print in, in
  every rating mode (and landscape) that prints more than one of them.
- The Cinema graphic badge is now a small disc with the day the film
  reaches home, month over day. Without a date it shows a popcorn bucket
  (in cinemas) or a clapperboard (in production). **Cinema Badge Style** is
  Auto, light or dark to suit the art under it, or Frosted; it replaces the
  popcorn's colours, which old URLs read as Auto.
  Series that haven't aired yet get it too, with their premiere date.
- A film that opens in cinemas and streams on the same day (a streamer's
  film with a small cinema run) now has a dated sash reading as a streaming
  release, not "Cinema". Films TMDB still lists as unreleased look up their
  release dates once they have a future release date, instead of assuming
  that date is a cinema opening.
- The Text Colour control is hidden for the frosted notch, which picks its
  own label colour and never used it.

### Presets in three kinds

- **Load preset** now has three tabs. **Core** holds the presets that ship
  with Posters+. **Operator** holds the instance's own, added in the
  dashboard's new **Presets** view from a pasted poster URL, with a picture
  rendered or uploaded there. **Mine** holds each user's own: *Save current
  settings* keeps the settings on screen, with the preview as its picture,
  in that browser only.
- The last URL a user imports (Import URL or a share link) is kept at the
  top of **Mine** as *Last imported URL*, replaced by the next import. While
  it matches the shape on screen, the right-click reset menu on a tab or
  heading also offers *Reset … to imported URL*, which puts just that
  section back to what the URL set.
- A preset is only settings. Access keys, API keys and the title are taken
  out of the URL before any preset is kept or loaded.

### Users can report a poster

- With **Poster reports** on (`REPORTS_ENABLED`, off by default), the
  configurator's live preview has a Report button. Users pick what is wrong
  (text on a textless poster, wrong art, wrong logo, wrong details, or
  something else), confirm, and the report lands in the dashboard's new
  **Reports** view, grouped by title with the poster as they saw it and a
  link into the Artwork editor.
- `REPORTS_PER_IP` limits reports per address per day (10). An address that
  sends more than `REPORTS_PURGE_THRESHOLD` (50) in a week has its
  unresolved reports deleted and is blocked, until unblocked in the
  dashboard. Reports you resolve stop counting against either limit;
  dismissed and deleted ones don't.
  Addresses are stored only as a keyed hash.
- The limits need each visitor's real address. Behind a reverse proxy
  whose forwarded addresses aren't trusted (`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` unset),
  reports pause and the dashboard says what to set.

### Black logos turn light on dark posters

- A black or near-black logo over a dark bottom (the usual vignette) is now
  lightened: its black ink turns white (dark greys light grey, navy pale
  blue), while any coloured parts keep their colour. Logos where the black
  is an outline, a card behind light letters or a shadow are left alone.
  This replaces the old whitening, which skipped many plain black logos and
  turned coloured accents white. Landscape logos get it too.

### Side notch position

- A notch set to Left, Right or Auto has a **Vertical Position** slider
  (`sash_chip_y`) that moves the side chip down from the corner; top badge
  groups beside it follow. A **Horizontal Position** slider (`sash_chip_x`)
  moves it in from its corner towards the middle, or out to the edge;
  badge groups beside it make room. On Auto both only apply when the chip
  goes to the side.

### Fixes

- Some series (Game of Thrones, Fleabag) 404'd when a client sent only
  their IMDb id: a duplicate movie entry on TMDB claiming the same IMDb id
  won the lookup, and the answer was kept for 90 days. A series now
  prefers TMDB's TV entry, and a TMDB id that TMDB has deleted is set
  aside: the title is found again by its IMDb id (straight away when the
  request sent one alongside, from the next request otherwise).
- The same titles lost their ratings: MDBList, asked about them as movies,
  had no record, and "no ratings" was kept for two weeks. An IMDb id MDBList
  doesn't know under one type is now asked as the other, and on upgrade
  the no-ratings rows this could have left behind are cleared once, with
  their posters.
- The configurator's Poster Resolution no longer resets to 500 when the
  page is refreshed.
- Import URL no longer replaces API keys you already have: a URL's
  TMDB or MDBList key only fills an empty field, and you're told when
  yours were kept.
- Importing a URL for another title now moves the title card, the
  IMDb/TMDB links and the Report button to it too, instead of leaving them
  on the previous title. Malformed title ids in an imported URL are
  ignored.

### A fourth graphic badge group

- Graphic badges can be split across four groups instead of three
  (`badge_group4`, and `landscape_badge_group4` for landscape), each with
  its own anchor, max, size and spacing.

### Popcorn badge for films still in cinemas

- Graphic badges have a new **In Cinemas (Popcorn)** badge (`cinema` in a
  badge group). It shows on a film that is only in cinemas or not out yet,
  so the poster can say so without the Cinema sash, or while the sash shows
  something else.
- **Popcorn Colour** (`badge_cinema_style`): By Streaming Date (default)
  turns it green inside a week of the film's digital release, amber inside
  two weeks, and red further off or when there is no date. Red, Black,
  White and Frosted are fixed colours.

### Edit the studio, director and cast lists in the dashboard

- The admin dashboard has a **Sash lists** view for the notable studios,
  directors and cast behind the Studio, Director and Cast sashes. It shows
  each list with TMDB pictures, lets you remove entries, change the label a
  sash shows, and search TMDB to add a studio or person, so names match
  TMDB's credits exactly. Entries TMDB has no exact credit for are flagged,
  since they can never match. Each list can go back to the built-in one.
- Four built-in entries never matched because TMDB spells them differently:
  BBC Film, LAIKA, Bong Joon Ho and Wong Kar-Wai. They now do, so films
  such as Aftersun, Coraline and Parasite get their sash.
- Changes apply without a restart. `discovery_overrides.json` is still where
  the lists live and can still be written by hand; it is now re-read within
  a few seconds of changing.

### Choose a title's art for everyone; TVDB as a poster source

- The admin dashboard has an **Artwork** tab. Search for a title and pick its
  textless poster, its Original Art poster, its logo and its landscape art
  from every TMDB, Fanart and TVDB image. The choice applies to everyone on the instance.
  Posters and logos are chosen per language, following each user's language
  order. A poster choice replaces the poster sources you tick (TMDB,
  Fanart, TVDB), and users on other sources get their usual pick. Only the
  images you choose are downloaded, once, however many users there are.
- You can also paste a link to any image, such as a ThePosterDB download
  link, or upload one. The server keeps its own copy.
- For titles with no textless poster, a backdrop can be cropped by hand into
  the textless poster: drag a poster-shaped frame over it and zoom as needed.
- An optional configurator shortcut (off by default, switched on in the
  editor) opens the previewed title's artwork in the dashboard.
- TVDB can be offered as a poster source (`TVDB_POSTER_SOURCE`,
  `poster_source=tvdb`). It uses TVDB's best no-language poster, which on
  TVDB means textless, or under Original Art its best poster in the user's
  language. Titles TVDB has nothing for keep their TMDB poster.
- The TVDB poster fallback (`TVDB_USE_POSTERS`) now only uses a no-language
  TVDB poster to replace a poster with text. It used to try one in the
  user's language first, and nearly all of those carry the title, often in a
  style the text scan misses.

### Landscape logo position, top band and graphic badges; per-type rating badges

- Landscape: the logo can sit left, centre or right, in the bottom row or at
  the top (`landscape_logo_pos`). The genre, year and score line moves out of
  its way, or can be placed on its own (`landscape_info_pos`), and the info
  badge can take any corner (`badge_pos=bottom_left` / `bottom_right`). A
  tinted top band in the bottom band's colour can be switched on
  (`landscape_vignette_top`) to back a top logo.
- Landscape can have Graphic Badges, with its own on switch and groups
  (`landscape_badge_display_mode=7`, `landscape_badge_group1`-`3`), so a Nuvio
  `{shape}` URL can set them for each layout. They stay off unless chosen. In
  the landscape view the Quality tab offers just Hidden and Graphic Badges.
- The black, silver and gold notches have an opacity slider
  (`sash_badge_opacity`). At its default they draw as before.
- Poster Source has a "TMDB, with fanart.tv for anime" choice
  (`poster_source=fanart_anime`), for instances that offer fanart.tv.
- Each rating badge can be shown on movies, TV or anime only, from chips on
  its row in the list (`rating_badges=imdb:mt`), and the number drawn can be
  capped (`rating_badge_max`), with sites further down the list filling in
  for missing scores.
- Logo tab: Bottom Anchor is at the top of the overlay controls, and the
  logo sliders hide while Textless is on.
- Right-click (or press and hold) a tab or a group heading to reset just that
  part to its defaults. API keys and the selected title are kept, and in the
  landscape view only landscape's own settings change.

### Sci-Fi or Fantasy for TV, and a genre order you can drag

- TMDB puts every TV show that is either sci-fi or fantasy in one merged
  "Sci-Fi & Fantasy" genre, which printed as Sci-Fi, so Game of Thrones and
  The Witcher were labelled Sci-Fi. The show's TMDB keywords now decide
  between Sci-Fi and Fantasy, with IMDb's genres (via Cinemeta) as the
  tie-break. Shows that neither decides print Sci-Fi as before. Cached TV
  metadata with the merged genre is fetched again once; nothing else is.
- The genre order (which of a title's genres is printed, and picks its
  fallback background and font) can be changed in the admin dashboard under
  Genres → Advanced, by dragging a list. There is one list for anime and one
  for everything else. `GENRE_PRIORITY` / `ANIME_GENRE_PRIORITY` take the
  same thing as comma-separated TMDB genre ids.
- New default order, checked against TMDB's most-voted films and shows:
  - Sci-Fi and Fantasy now rank above Mystery, which TMDB puts on much of
    its TV, so Stranger Things and Dark stop printing Mystery.
  - Fantasy sits beside Sci-Fi, so Buffy and Good Omens print Fantasy
    rather than Comedy.
  - War ranks above Action and History, so Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan
    print War.
  - Animation is now near the bottom, because the poster already shows a
    title is animated. Coco and The Lion King print Family.
- A new order takes effect on posters that are already cached. The genre label
  is now worked out from the title's genres on every render rather than read
  back from the cached rating row, and a changed order re-renders cached
  posters once.

### Client insets, and sliders

- The trending ribbon takes the Primary Client's top inset, like the notch:
  on Stremio Desktop/Web it grows upwards by that much, so the client's crop
  of the top edge no longer cuts into it.
- The configurator's bar and notch inset sliders are gone; the Primary
  Client sets both. `bar_bottom_inset` and `sash_badge_inset` still work in
  a URL, and the configurator keeps them when it imports one.
- Sliders have a thicker gold track and a larger handle, and the value no
  longer runs into the edge of a narrow row.
- Sliders sit on the same line as their label.
- On a phone, the six tabs fit across the panel instead of cutting off
  Weights at the edge; the small preview moves to the top reliably when it
  would cover the end of a tab, including one too short to scroll; the
  Trending Catalogs Addon link has a Copy button, and the full-screen
  preview keeps its buttons directly under the poster whether or not the
  browser's toolbar is showing.
- Back (or the back gesture) closes an open Load preset, Import or What's
  new dialog first, and only then the full-screen preview.
- Tapping a button on a phone no longer sometimes opens its tooltip over what
  the button just showed (e.g. the IMDb/TMDB menu).

### Code review fixes (27 Sep 2026)

- Badge logos: a re-uploaded file on Wikimedia Commons no longer loses its
  mark. The pinned revision is found in the file's history and fetched from
  its archive URL, which never changes. A mark that no revision matches is
  left out and the poster is cached as usual; before, every poster showing
  that badge was re-rendered on every view. Graphic badges now back off
  after a failed download (10 min) instead of retrying on every render.
- Provisional posters (quality still loading, a rating source down, a text
  scan queued) are kept for `PROVISIONAL_CACHE_TTL` (default 300 s), with no
  ETag and a max-age no longer than that. Before, they were never kept, so a
  long upstream outage meant a full render on every view. `0` restores the
  old behaviour.
- Quality: a source that fails one title (a 4xx for an id it doesn't index,
  or AIOStreams with no results because one of its scrapers errored) backs
  off only that title, for an hour, instead of the whole source.
- Deferred text scans on a busy worker run anyway after waiting 30 s, one
  at a time, rather than waiting for the worker to go idle.
- The trending refresh re-renders the titles whose rank changed. Before, it
  re-rendered only the ones whose rank stayed put.
- Cache warming reads and writes metadata and logos in
  `DEFAULT_LOGO_LANGUAGE`, not always English. Series poster art is stored
  under one key whether the client says `series` or `tv`.
- The SIMKL "Get a link code" button and unlinking wake the watchlist loop
  immediately, instead of at its next cycle.
- A TMDB error while checking an IMDb id sent beside a TMDB id keeps the IMDb
  id (the render is provisional) instead of dropping it and caching the
  poster under another identity. The failed lookup isn't repeated for 60 s.
- `WORKERS>1`: saving settings no longer reverts what another worker saved,
  and the dashboard shows the file as it is now. Prune, cache warming, the
  digital-release poll, the trending refresh and the watchlist (with its
  SIMKL link flow) run in one worker; another takes over if it exits.
- Performance: image decoding, resizing and encoding, logo rasterising, and
  the remaining cache writes run off the event loop. `/stats` is computed
  off the loop and reused for 30 s. The composite prune has an index and
  runs in batches, and the database file shrinks after a big eviction.
- Bounds: `logo_language` must be a language code, float parameters are
  rounded to 3 places, and `COMPOSITE_MAX_ENTRIES` now defaults to 500000
  (about 50 GB). Set it to `0` to keep the old unbounded behaviour.
- Security and hygiene:
  - `/debug/canvas` accepts only known genres (before, it could read any
    `.png` on disk).
  - `?debug=1` returns JSON even for cached posters.
  - Non-ASCII digits in ids and numbers are rejected cleanly instead of
    causing a 500.
  - The trending addon's access key is redacted from logs, and so are the
    keys in the Plex and Jellyfin sync logs.
  - An `ACCESS_KEY` shorter than 12 characters logs a warning, and wrong
    guesses against it lock the address out.
  - A failed TVDB login backs off: 5 min, or until restart for a rejected
    key.
  - The PP-OCR download has a timeout and is retried hourly, and renders
    wait at most 30 s for a text scan.
  - `/search` and `/resolve-imdb` answer 502/504 when TMDB is unreachable
    or times out.
  - uvicorn runs with `--no-server-header`.
  - Actions are pinned to commits and the base image to a digest, with
    Dependabot keeping them current.

### AniList and Kitsu scores for every anime title

- AniList and Kitsu scores used to reach only titles requested by that
  site's own id; MDBList carries only MyAnimeList. Any anime title is now
  matched to both sites through the anime id list (a series uses its first
  season), when a weight or a rating badge uses them. Fetched once and cached
  with the anime metadata.
- Fixed: a title's first fetch saved that request's own extras (its anime
  site's score and age rating, the IMDb dataset value, TMDB's average) into
  the rating record every request shares, so what a title showed depended on
  which request reached it first.

### Rating badges

- New Rating Badges list at the bottom of the Rating tab (`rating_badges=imdb,tomatoes`):
  each chosen site's own score behind its logo, in place of the ★ and the
  weighted score. Clean puts them after the genre, Minimalist before each
  score, and the Bar after its year and genre (with a label that shows the
  rating). The rest of the label keeps its room and the badges fill what is
  left. The Rating Bar has no printed score and doesn't draw them.
- Posters+ (the weighted score under the service's own mark), IMDb, Rotten
  Tomatoes (fresh or rotten), Popcornmeter (upright or spilled),
  Metacritic, Metacritic User, Letterboxd, Trakt, TMDB, Roger Ebert,
  MyAnimeList, AniList and Kitsu. Only as many as fit are drawn, in list order,
  and titles missing all of them keep the weighted score.
- Badge Style Mono (`rating_badge_style=mono`) draws every badge in the
  text's colour, as a solid shape with the logo cut out, for tinted
  vignettes a coloured logo would clash with.
- Scores print on each site's own scale (7.8, 92%, 3.9) or, with Badge Scores
  set to P+ scale (`rating_badge_scale=normalized`), on the weighted score's.
- The badges are round (IMDb, TMDB, Letterboxd, Trakt, MyAnimeList, AniList,
  Kitsu, Roger Ebert's gold thumbs-up) in each site's colours, so they read
  as one row.
- Logos are downloaded once per instance, pinned by SHA-1, and none ship in
  the repo; a render missing one isn't cached. Existing URLs and cached
  posters are unaffected.

### Second textless poster before the backdrop

- When a poster TMDB tags as textless turns out to have its title burned in
  and the title has at least 6 textless posters, the runner-up is scanned once
  and used if it's clean; otherwise the backdrop fallback runs as before. Only
  one alternate is ever tried, since the scan runs on the first render. Part of
  `TEXTLESS_BACKDROP_FALLBACK`. Titles pick up the alternate within a week,
  as their cached TMDB metadata refreshes.
- Burned-in text detection also catches stacks of credit or tagline lines it
  can't read, such as Cyrillic or Greek copy, which it previously passed as
  clean. Existing scan results are kept; only new scans use it.

### Logo priority as a list

- The Language Priority dropdown is now a Logo Priority list, reordered and
  switched on or off like the sash priority: Native, Original, Custom,
  English (TMDB, then Metahub), Neutral (logos TMDB tags with no language)
  and Text. `logo_priority` takes the list (`logo_priority=native,english,text`)
  as well as the old preset names, which keep meaning the same order and
  keep their cached composites.
- Orders the presets could not express, such as English before Original or
  no Neutral logos at all. Leaving Text off draws no title when no logo is
  found.
- TVDB logos (when enabled) follow the same order, and are now also tried for
  what used to be the Native → English → Neutral modes.

### Larger posters

- `resolution=780` renders portrait posters at 780×1170 from TMDB's `w780`
  art, and `1000`, `1500` or `2000` from the original art (backdrop crops and
  logos from the originals above 500), for clients that draw posters large.
  Same layout at any size: pixel settings scale with the canvas. About 2×,
  3×, 7× and 12× the render time and file size; URLs without it are
  unchanged and keep their cached composites.

### Notch on the side, and graphic quality badges

- The frosted notch can sit to one side (`sash_badge_pos=left|right`, the
  Position setting in the configurator), or choose per poster (`auto`): beside
  the graphic badges when a title has some along the top, centred when not;
  `auto_hug` keeps those badges against the chip, clear of the corner. It becomes a rounded chip floating
  in from that top corner, sized to its label, which leaves the middle of the
  top edge free. With it on the left, quality and age badges move to the top
  right.
- New quality mode, **Graphic Badges** (`badge_display_mode=7`): Dolby Vision,
  Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, HDR, resolution and the US certificate in up to three
  groups. Each group has its own size, spacing and anchor (beside the chip,
  any corner, above or below the logo, or a custom position for dodging badges a client draws), a maximum
  number of badges and its own list order; it uses whatever space the logo,
  rating and sash leave, moving off a taken corner rather than overlapping
  it. When Dolby Vision and Atmos share a group they share one combined mark.
  Network and studio badges show a TV show's network, or the curated studio
  that made a film, as white marks from TMDB's logos. A layout with only the
  certificate, network and studio never touches the quality source.
- A poster that shows no quality at all is no longer held out of the cache
  while the quality source is backing off. The Dolby and DTS:X artwork is fetched once from Wikimedia Commons
  (see README for credits); the certificate is one TMDB call per title per
  month.

### Backdrop crops find close-up faces

- When no face is found in a backdrop, it is checked again at half size. The
  face detector misses large close-ups at full size, so the portrait crop fell
  back to a guess and could frame a wall, a background or the back of a hood
  instead of the actor. Cached backdrop crops are redone.

### Faster, more accurate burned-in-text scans

- Textless posters are scanned for burned-in text in two passes: first at
  0.65x size, then at full size only when the small pass comes back clear but
  still found a title-sized block of text (about a quarter of scans). A scan
  takes roughly a third less time: ~85 ms instead of ~130 ms for a typical
  clean poster on a 4-core ARM host.
- Fixes a mismatch between detected text boxes and their confidence scores.
  RapidOCR sorted the boxes without their scores, so the size, position and
  confidence rules were often judging one box by another's score. The detector
  is now driven directly, which also drops some wasted preprocessing.
- On ~2,900 cached posters, checking every changed verdict by eye: 4 wrong,
  against 25 before. Stylised titles are caught more often, and signs,
  shirts and chalkboards in the scene are less often mistaken for a title.
- Cached scan results are redone under the new detector signature, so each
  textless poster is scanned once more as it is next requested.

### Landscape star beside the score

- Landscape gains a **Star beside score** switch (`landscape_score_star=true`),
  under Core → Landscape. The separator in front of the score becomes a star,
  as Clean mode has it on a portrait: `Genre • Year ★ 87`. It hides with Hide
  Rating, and works with the out-of-10 switch (`★ 8.7`).

### Unrated posters in Clean and Minimalist

- Clean mode shows just the genre when a title has no rating, instead of
  "★ N/A".
- Minimalist with append set to Year draws the rating separator light grey when
  there is no rating, instead of leaving a gap between genre and year.
- Cached composites now record the drawing revision that made them and a few
  facts about what they show (for now, the score). A drawing change that only
  affects some posters re-renders just those, rather than the whole cache.
  Posters cached before this update have no facts, so unrated ones keep the
  old look until they expire (`COMPOSITE_CACHE_TTL`).

### Backdrop for fake textless posters

- `TEXTLESS_BACKDROP_FALLBACK` (Text detection, on by default): when a
  poster TMDB tags as textless turns out to have its title burned in, the
  poster is swapped for a crop of the title's backdrop with a logo on it,
  instead of being served as-is without one. It needs a logo to put on the
  crop (or a `textless=true` request) and a crop that scans clean; otherwise
  the poster is kept as before.
- It costs about half a second on the first render of an affected title
  (backdrop download, crop, one more text scan). Later renders reuse the
  cached crop and scan. Titles above `TEXTLESS_DETECTION_MAX_VOTES` get the
  swap once the background scans have finished.
- Posters already cached with a fake textless poster keep it until they
  expire (`COMPOSITE_CACHE_TTL`); turning the setting off re-renders them.

### Hide Year, and an optional Admin link

- **Rating → Labels → Hide Year** (`hide_year=true`) drops the release year
  from the label in every rating mode and from the landscape info strip, and
  can be set per shape (`landscape_hide_year`) like Hide Genre. Minimalist's
  Year mode shows the score only as the colour of the separator before the
  year, so with the year hidden it prints the score instead.
- `SHOW_ADMIN_LINK` (Access & serving, off by default) adds an Admin link to
  the configurator's header. It stays hidden while the dashboard is disabled,
  so turning it on without an `ADMIN_KEY` shows nothing.

### PublicMetaDB watchlist

- `WATCHLIST_SOURCE=pmdb` reads the Watchlist sash from a
  [PublicMetaDB](https://publicmetadb.com) account's watchlist, with a key
  from Settings → API set as `PMDB_API_KEY`. `PMDB_LIST_ID` reads another
  list instead, including someone else's public one.
- PMDB lists carry only TMDB ids, so the sash appears wherever the title's
  TMDB id is known — with a server or client TMDB key — and not on
  Cinemeta-only renders.

### Faster poster rendering

- A poster takes about 25% less CPU to render the first time and about 45%
  less when its art has been rendered before (a different client or setting,
  a trending change, a cache refresh). On a 4-core server a cold catalog grid
  now renders about twice as fast. Rendered posters are unchanged pixel for
  pixel.
- WebP posters are encoded with less compression effort: about half the time
  for files about 1.5% larger.
- The faces the tinted vignette avoids are detected once per image and
  remembered, instead of on every render.
- The vignette's blur, the text-title fitting and the notch sash reuse work
  that doesn't change between renders.

### Trending catalogs addon has a logo

- The addon's manifest now points to a Posters+ Trending logo, so it no
  longer shows up blank in Stremio's addon list. Its address comes from
  `PUBLIC_URL` when set, otherwise from the request, like the poster links.

### Reliability and hardening

- Errors reported on `/server-caps` and `/stats` show less detail.
- Debug pages encode the parameters they echo back.
- A custom top or bottom gradient's height and opacity are range-checked like
  every other setting, and number parameters no longer accept `nan`.
- An access key with non-ASCII characters is refused with a 403 rather than a
  500.
- The admin dashboard refuses `nan` and `inf` in number settings. Before, they
  were saved and broke whatever used them after a restart.
- Stream scraper requests are logged by host only.
- Behind a reverse proxy, set `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` to the proxy's address so
  the admin dashboard sees each visitor's own address (now documented). The
  admin lockout table no longer grows without limit.
- New optional `PUBLIC_URL` setting for the address used in the trending
  addon's poster links. Without it they still come from the request's headers.
- The image is about 80 MB smaller, keeps its code read-only to the app, and
  startup no longer re-owns every file in the cache.
- A poster request riding on another request's render could wait forever if
  that render was cancelled or failed early. It now falls back to rendering
  the poster itself.
- Changing `ACCESS_KEY` no longer breaks the re-rendering of cached trending
  and watchlist posters. The key is no longer stored with them.
- `/debug/canvas` now caches what it renders and renders off the event loop.
- Unknown parameters (`&x=…`) no longer create a separate cached poster, and
  URLs that differ only in spelling (`0.3` / `0.30`, `1` / `true`) now share
  one. Cached posters are re-rendered once after updating.
- Cache reads and writes on the poster path no longer run on the event loop,
  and a change in the trending list clears the old posters in one pass over
  the cache instead of one pass per title.
- Upstream JSON is now fetched compressed.

### Configurator no longer adds a stale access key

- The configurator remembered the access key in the browser and fell back to
  it when the page's URL had none. After the server's `ACCESS_KEY` was removed,
  that old key kept going into every copied URL. The key now comes only from
  the page's own URL, and any copy saved by an earlier version is cleared.
- A key left in a bookmarked configurator URL after the server stopped
  requiring one is dropped as well, so it no longer ends up in copied URLs.

### Weight sliders take typed values

- Clicking a rating weight's percentage now opens it for typing, like every
  other slider in the configurator. Typed weights update the total and the
  URL straight away.

### API keys no longer cost AIOMetadata its posters

- A TMDB or MDBList key entered in the configurator put `{tmdb_key}` /
  `{mdblist_key}` in the copied URL. AIOMetadata drops the whole URL when a
  placeholder it can't fill is required, so anyone without that key in
  AIOMetadata (or who removed it later) lost every poster. AIOMetadata and
  Xperience URLs now use the optional `{tmdb_key?}` / `{mdblist_key?}`, and
  a missing key falls back to the server's own. Bingecat and Discover+ keep
  the plain form, since they reject `{name?}`.
- A key parameter that arrives still holding its placeholder is read as no
  key, not sent to TMDB or MDBList as one.
- An MDBList key in the URL that has used up its daily quota now hands over
  to the server's MDBList key, when one is set, until the quota resets.
  Before, that user's ratings stopped until the next day.

### Trending lists get a second attempt

- A trending list that couldn't be read (TMDB, a custom source or AniList) is
  now read once more after a short pause. If that fails too, it is left for
  five minutes instead of being retried on every poster request.
- Posters drawn while their list was unreadable are kept for those five
  minutes instead of seven days, so a title's rank comes back as soon as the
  list does. The scheduled refresh also retries within the hour when a list
  has never been read.

### Trending catalogs addon

- A Trending row in your metadata addon is built from its own copy of the
  list, so its order rarely matched the "#N Today" on its posters.
  PostersPlus now serves the lists behind the Trending sashes as a Stremio
  addon with Trending Movies, Series and Anime catalogs. It is on by default
  (`TRENDING_CATALOGS_ENABLED=false` turns it off). Import it into AIOMetadata (cache time 0) and each row's order
  matches its labels. The configurator shows the manifest URL.
- Trending Anime is AniList's trending list. With the addon on, a poster
  requested with an AniList id shows its rank on that list rather than its
  TMDB TV rank.

### Trending ranks change together

- Two posters could both read "#10 Today". Each one was cached for a day from
  when it was drawn, so posters drawn before the daily refresh stayed in
  apps beside ones drawn after it. Every poster showing a rank now expires
  exactly when the ranks refresh, and apps are told the same.
- With TMDB as the source, the scheduled refresh (`TRENDING_FETCH_TIME`) never
  actually fetched new ranks. It redrew the trending posters with the old
  ones instead. It now refreshes the ranks and then redraws those posters.
  Without a fetch time, the refresh happens 24 hours after the previous
  one rather than on a clock that restarts with the container.
- Cache warming no longer replaces ranks that are still current.
- A title TMDB listed on two pages no longer leaves a rank number empty and
  pushes the titles around it a place out.
- Trending anime posters are now redrawn and cleared from memory like any
  other title when their rank changes.

### The configurator remembers your settings on reload

- **Minimum Quality to Display** set to HD Web came back as the strictest
  tier but one after a reload, so most titles lost their quality badge in
  the preview and in copied URLs. A few other settings left at the server's
  default reverted the same way. Settings are now saved in full. Anything
  already lost needs setting once more.
- **Badge Size** no longer resets to the mode's default on every reload or
  when a landscape preset is loaded. Changing the display mode still picks
  that mode's size.
- With the portrait rating hidden, your rating weights were left out of the
  saved settings and out of Nuvio's `{shape}` URL, so landscape posters were
  scored with the server's weights. They're kept now.

### Shows waiting to premiere stay unreleased

- TMDB sometimes marks a show "Returning Series" before its first episode
  airs. Those shows read "Season 1" as if renewed, and Hide Rating Until
  Released showed their score. They now read like any show waiting to
  premiere ("Sep 30 Premiere"), and the score stays hidden until an episode
  has aired.

### Monster resolves as one series

- IMDb lists Monster (`tt13207736`) as one anthology with a season per story.
  TMDB lists each story as its own show, so the IMDb id sometimes failed to
  resolve and the metadata provider's plain poster showed instead. Monster
  now renders as its newest story that has premiered: Ed Gein today, and
  Lizzie Borden from the day it airs.
- A TMDB id now decides the title. An IMDb id sent beside it is kept only
  when TMDB links that TMDB id to it, so a Monster story asked for by its
  TMDB id gets its own rating, sash and quality, not the whole anthology's.
  An IMDb-only request for Monster renders exactly like its newest story's
  TMDB id. Ordinary titles are unaffected.

### Importing a URL keeps you on this instance

- Importing a URL copied from another instance no longer carries that
  instance's address or access key over. Copy config now always points at
  the instance you're using, with its own key, so switching instances is
  just a matter of importing your old URL.

### Landscape score out of 10

- Landscape gains the **Display score out of 10** switch portrait already had
  (`landscape_score_out_of_10=true`), under Core → Landscape. The score on the
  `Genre • Year • Score` line reads `8.7` rather than `87`, and a perfect
  score reads `10`. It hides with Hide Rating, as the portrait switches do.

### QualiCache trust defaults to medium

- `QUALICACHE_MIN_TRUST` now defaults to `medium`, so releases from unknown
  groups count as well as the known ranked ones. Set it to `high` to keep the
  old behaviour.

### Hide Rating Until Released

- A new **Hide Rating Until Released** switch (`hide_unreleased_rating=true`)
  hides the score only on titles nobody can have watched yet: a film not out
  in cinemas or anywhere else, or a series that has not aired an episode.
  Trakt and IMDb accept ratings for announced titles, so a show years from
  air could print a score from a handful of votes. Everything else keeps its
  score, and a hidden one comes back by itself once the title is out: the
  poster is re-rendered on the release-status schedule.
- It uses the same release status as the info sash, but doesn't need the
  status sash turned on, and turning it on doesn't add a sash or greyscale
  the art. Films need a TMDB key, or Cinemeta, for their release dates.
  Without either, a film's score is always shown.
- A series TMDB still lists as "In Production" keeps its score once an
  episode has aired. Films that have only had a festival premiere still
  count as unreleased.

### One Nuvio URL for both shapes

- Nuvio's custom poster pattern gained a `{shape}` placeholder, which its
  resolver fills with the shape the catalogue asked for. **Copy config** now
  emits `shape={shape}` for Nuvio, so a single URL covers the portrait slot,
  the 16:9 slot and the Continue Watching backdrop — where every other client
  still needs the landscape URL copied separately from the landscape view.
  The placeholder's presence is the switch on Nuvio's side: without it, it
  replaces only portrait posters and leaves the other shapes alone.
- Because that URL is resolved for both layouts, it is not filtered to either:
  the portrait-only settings ride along and the landscape choices are emitted
  whichever way the preview is pointing — the URL is the same from either view.
- The settings the configurator keeps per shape — the bottom vignette tint and
  its sliders, Hide Genre, Hide Rating, Textless and the sash mode — now also
  take a `landscape_`-prefixed parameter (`landscape_hide_rating`,
  `landscape_vignette_poster_color_bottom`, …) that only a landscape render
  reads. A dual URL carries both values, so each layout gets its own: with one
  parameter between them, the portrait value would have reached the 16:9 slot
  too, and a URL copied with the portrait defaults would have rendered
  landscape without its tinted band. A landscape render reads the prefixed
  parameter, then the plain one, then its own default, so `shape=landscape`
  URLs written before the split render unchanged. The configurator writes the
  prefixed form for landscape URLs, leaves out any value a render would pick
  anyway, and imports a dual URL into both shapes' settings.
- `shape` accepts `poster` as a synonym for `portrait` — Nuvio's word for the
  2:3 slot. It already rendered correctly, because an unrecognised shape fell
  through to the portrait default, but the spelling reached the composite
  cache key: `poster`, `portrait`, an unsubstituted `{shape}` and no shape at
  all were four cache entries for one render, and are now one.
- `shape=square` answers `400` instead. Nuvio asks for it when an addon
  declares `posterShape: "square"` on a catalogue item, and there is no square
  renderer to answer with — a portrait poster squashed into a 1:1 tile is
  worse than not answering, and the error hands the item back to Nuvio's
  fallback, which restores the addon's own artwork.

### Series release status and dates

- A series' release status came from TMDB's status word alone, and TMDB's
  "Returning Series" means "not declared finished", not "on air" — so The Last
  of Us (last episode May 2025) and Severance (March 2025) both read **Airing**.
  The status now comes from the episode data TMDB already sends with the
  series, at no extra API call: **Airing** only while episodes are going out
  (one in the last fortnight, or the next due within one); **Renewed** when
  TMDB lists the next season; and no status at all for a show returning in
  name only, so a lower sash gets the space instead of a claim.
- With release dates on, a series is dated the way a movie is: `Dec 25
  Premiere` for a show that hasn't aired, `Mar 4 Season 3` for a dated next
  season, `Jan 8 Returns` after a mid-season break. The weekly next-episode
  date is left off on purpose — it would change every week and crowd out
  better sashes. Translated in every shipped language; where the window comes
  before the day the season uses the short form (`T3 4 mar`), so the two
  numbers don't run together.
- New **Renewed** sash slot, last in the default order so saved sash orders
  keep their positions. A saved list that names Airing gets Renewed right
  behind it (add `-renewed` to leave it out), since those shows used to read
  Airing.

### A leak post no longer outranks an announced digital date

- The Odyssey (2026) showed "Streaming" while still in cinemas. Its IMDb id
  had been posted to r/movieleaks in August — a knock-off film posted under
  Nolan's id — and the digital-release cache takes every IMDb id in every post
  at face value, overriding TMDB's status. TMDB meanwhile listed the digital
  release for November. The feed is there to catch releases that beat TMDB's
  date, and real ones beat it by days, so a leak now counts unless TMDB
  schedules the digital release more than 14 days out — for both the
  release-status sash and the "New" sash. With no TMDB date to compare (no
  key, or the lookup failed) it is trusted as before. Composites already
  cached with the wrong status re-render when their row expires (at most 30
  days, sooner if the title's next release date comes first).

### Anime from clients that only send the anime id

- Anime landscape posters requested through Nuvio's own `{shape}` URL came
  back as the genre canvas, where the same titles through AIOMetadata (as the
  Nuvio HTPC fork uses) rendered properly. The difference was the ids: Nuvio's
  resolver turns a `kitsu:7442` catalogue item into a Kitsu id and nothing
  else, while AIOMetadata sends `tmdb_id` and `imdb_id` alongside it. The anime
  providers ship one cover image and no backdrop or logo, so without a TMDB id
  the landscape render had nothing to draw on, and portrait anime went without
  a logo too.
- New `ANIME_ID_MAP_ENABLED` (on by default) fills in the TMDB and IMDb ids an
  anime request didn't send, from Fribb's community Kitsu/AniList mapping — the
  same data AIOMetadata resolves from — downloaded daily into a local table. A
  Kitsu-only request now renders the same poster, byte for byte, as the
  AIOMetadata request for the title. Ids the client did send are kept, the TMDB
  id is only used when it is the kind being rendered (movie or series), and
  the art and metadata still come from the anime provider. A sequel season
  maps to its parent show, as it does in AIOMetadata, so its logo and backdrop
  are the show's.

### Hide Rating

- **Rating → Labels → Hide Rating** (`hide_rating=true`) takes the score off
  the poster in whichever display mode is drawing it, alongside the existing
  Hide Genre. Every mode loses its own representation of it: the Rating Bar
  mode's accent bar, Clean's `★ 87`, Minimalist's score segment, and Bar
  mode's `★ 87` along with the fill in the two Rating Bar styles, which fall
  back to plain Frosted and Pure Black rather than drawing an empty stripe.
- A score shown as a colour is still a score, so those go too. Minimalist's
  Year layout carries the rating in the separator between the genre and the
  year; with the rating hidden that separator drops back to the text colour,
  and — having nothing left to encode — it is drawn even for a title with no
  score, where before the slot was left empty.
- The controls that only style a score go with it: the Glow group, the Colour
  Palette, the out-of-10 switches, Minimalist's Rating Separator and Bar
  mode's Rating Bar Colour. The Bar mode Style you picked is kept while they
  are hidden, so turning Hide Rating back off gives the Rating Bar back. Like
  Hide Genre the switch is kept per shape, and in landscape
  (`landscape_hide_rating`) it drops the score from the 16:9 info strip.

### Landscape in the configurator

- The preview header has a landscape button. It switches the live preview to
  the 16:9 render, shows the landscape choices under Core → Landscape, and
  makes Copy config copy the `shape=landscape` URL (the shape is saved with
  the rest of the settings and round-trips through Import; presets leave it
  alone).
- In landscape view the Rating, Logo and Quality tabs are hidden, along with
  every other control the landscape renderer does not read (vignette levels
  and top-band toggles, fallback style, sash and notch styling), so nothing
  on screen can be reported as not working there. Hide Genre, Hide Rating
  and Textless, which it does read, move into the Landscape group meanwhile. The landscape
  URL carries only the settings that apply; the saved configuration still
  carries everything, so the portrait settings survive a reload.
- Landscape has defaults of its own for the settings it shares with portrait:
  a bare `shape=landscape` URL renders the tinted band (two-tone, saturation
  2.0, lightness 1.3, blur 1.0, local blending off) with the badge matched to
  it, the textless art with the logo, the badge top-left and the sash shown.
  An explicit parameter still wins, and portrait defaults are unchanged. The
  configurator keeps a separate set of those values per shape, so switching
  the preview never disturbs the other shape's settings, and its Sash mode
  reads Hidden | Shown in landscape — there is no diagonal sash or notch
  there, only the badge.
- Bottom Colour from Poster can actually be switched off in landscape. The
  configurator only ever wrote the toggle's on state, so off was an absent
  parameter — the server's default — and in landscape that default is on.
  Both vignette colour toggles are now written in both states (and still
  dropped from the URL when they match the shape's default).
- Three landscape presets (tinted band, dark band, original art). The preset
  gallery is grouped by shape with the shape being previewed first, a preset
  switches the preview to its own shape, and it only touches the controls
  that shape reads — a landscape preset leaves the portrait configuration
  alone and vice versa. Import from a config URL follows `shape=landscape`.
- Added `landscape_badge_scale` (Sash → Badge → Badge Size, 0.6–2.0):
  scales the landscape info badge's type and padding together, for a shelf
  watched from across a room.
- Added `landscape_color_link` (Sash → Badge → Colour Link): the info
  badge takes the tinted band's colour, or the band takes the whole-frame
  colour the badge uses. Hue only — the band still darkens it and the badge
  still lifts it.
- Landscape renders of anime ids (AniList / Kitsu) drew on the genre canvas:
  the providers ship one cover and no backdrop. They now use TMDB's backdrops,
  already fetched for the logo list, when the request carries a `tmdb_id` and
  a TMDB key is available; the cover remains the portrait art.
- The landscape band no longer shows a line where it starts. Its alpha ramp
  was the portrait curve, which begins at full slope; on a short canvas the
  eye reads that kink as a rule across the art, and no height or strength
  setting could hide it. The band is now a smoothstep — flat at its top edge
  and at its peak — with a gamma that gathers the darkness under the text
  row, so it can be tall enough to fade properly (0.45 h) without reaching
  visibly into the picture.
- The logo's height is no longer tied to the band: it used to be capped at
  the band's top edge, so a shallower band shrank every stacked logo with
  it. The logo keeps its own 0.30 h ceiling and stands on its drop shadow.
- Cached landscape composites are re-rendered once (render cache version 7).
- The landscape logo's drop shadow was blurred on a canvas exactly the logo's
  size, so it clamped at the edges and came out as a straight-edged slab
  around any logo whose ink reached its bounding box. It is now built on a
  padded canvas and reads as a soft pool under the wordmark.
- The landscape info pill is about 15% larger and casts a soft drop shadow,
  so it stands off bright art in the top corners the way the logo does; the
  genre / year / score strip casts a tighter one for the same reason, with
  the letters punched out of it so the translucent type does not darken,
  and its ink lifted a step.
- Landscape prefers a wide logo: within the language bucket that wins, a
  logo with an aspect ratio of 2.0 or more is ranked ahead of stacked or
  square ones, which the wide, short logo box could only draw small. Votes
  still decide among the wide ones, and portrait selection is unchanged.
- The landscape band's poster-colour tint now honours Blend Into Nearby Art
  the way the portrait bottom vignette does, and samples at the finer cell
  counts the wider canvas was meant to use, so the low end of Blur follows
  the art instead of going coarse.

### Copy config picks your client

- **Copy config** copies the URL in the shape your client can actually
  resolve. The first press opens a short menu — AIOMetadata, Nuvio, Xperience,
  Bingecat or Discover+ — and after that a left-click copies for that client
  again while a right-click reopens the menu to pick another (press and hold on
  touch, which has no right-click). The choice is remembered per browser,
  marked with a tick in the menu, and named in the button's tooltip along with
  where to paste the result.
- AIOMetadata, Nuvio and Xperience get both core ids in the optional form —
  `tmdb_id={tmdb_id?}&imdb_id={imdb_id?}`. A *required* placeholder the client
  cannot fill makes the resolver drop the whole URL, and both ids hit that in
  practice: TMDB has no IMDb link for some titles, and a client's catalogue
  often has no TMDB id for one. Since either id renders on its own now, an
  unresolved one is simply not sent instead of costing the poster. This also
  brings the IMDb-keyed extras (Metahub logo fallback, digital-release
  detection, automatic quality badges) straight from the template.
- That is one URL for three of the five clients: Nuvio's resolver takes
  AIOMetadata's placeholder set and Xperience builds Nuvio configurations, so
  all three share it. Bingecat and Discover+ reject `{name?}` at config time
  and keep `tmdb_id={tmdb_id}` in the required form — correct there, since it
  is the only id they send and a title they cannot resolve one for has nothing
  to render from anyway. As each gains the form it moves onto the optimal URL,
  and once neither is left every client shares a single one.
- The **Anime IDs** toggle is gone. Whether `stremio_id={id}` can be resolved
  is a fact about the client rather than a preference, so it now rides on the
  template: on for the clients that can substitute it, off for the ones that
  cannot. Existing URLs are unaffected, and the client choice is not
  part of the saved configuration, so a shared or imported config URL never
  carries someone else's client with it.

### Identity

- `/poster` and `/logo` accept either id. An `imdb_id`-only request (or a
  `tt…` `stremio_id`) is resolved to a TMDB id through TMDB's `/find` and
  persisted, so it renders exactly as a request carrying both ids would and
  shares its composite cache entry with one. TMDB's type wins when it
  disagrees with the request. Missing both ids is a 400 that names both.

### MDBList burst limit

- MDBList throttles per IP as well as per key: a burst of calls within a few
  seconds gets 503s, then `429` with `Retry-After: 10` for every key on the
  address, with the daily quota untouched. That 429 was handled as a key
  problem — the key was cooled down, a sibling key was tried (and refused
  too), and one without `Retry-After` parked the key for an hour with
  thousands of calls left. A burst 429 or 503 now pauses all MDBList calls
  from the process for `Retry-After` (10 s when absent) and touches no key;
  a live render waits the pause out and retries once, so the poster is
  complete and cacheable rather than provisional. Quota 429s keep the
  sleep-until-reset-and-rotate behaviour.
- Added `MDBLIST_MIN_INTERVAL` (default `0.2` s): a minimum spacing between
  MDBList request starts shared by live renders and the cache warmer. With
  `MDBLIST_CONCURRENCY=3` an unpaced cold catalog warm reached ~10 calls/s,
  which is where the limit was hit. `/stats` and the admin overview show the
  pacing rate and any burst pause in progress.

### Cinemeta fallback

- Added Stremio's Cinemeta catalogue as a key-less, IMDb-keyed art and
  metadata source (`CINEMETA_ENABLED`, on by default). An instance with no
  TMDB key — on the server or the request — renders any title it has an IMDb
  id for: the Metahub background cropped to portrait with the logo on top,
  the one-sheet in original-art mode, the background as shot in landscape.
  Title, year, genre, runtime, status, cast and director come from the same
  document; MDBList ratings, awards and quality badges are unaffected.
  Cinemeta's own TMDB id is what resolves an `imdb_id`-only request without
  a key.
- The same path carries a title TMDB has no record for when a key is
  configured, and Metahub art is tried as a last tier before the genre
  canvas when TMDB knows a title but has no artwork. Art availability is
  probed on the CDN (Cinemeta names image urls for every title) and cached.
- A `tmdb_id`-only request without a key is still refused — Cinemeta is
  IMDb-keyed — with a 400 that says an `imdb_id` would render.
- The configurator searches without a TMDB key: `/search` falls back to
  Cinemeta's catalogue (IMDb-keyed rows in TMDB's shape), a new
  `/resolve-tmdb` finds the TMDB id on selection (TMDB's `/find` with a key,
  Cinemeta's `moviedb_id` without), and the preview renders from the IMDb id
  alone when there is none. The Presets' ignored inset parameters are gone.
- More sashes survive without a TMDB key. A Cinemeta-spined movie takes its
  release status from Cinemeta's theatrical and disc dates plus MDBList's
  `released_digital` (remembered whenever a rating is fetched), so a film
  that has gone digital reads Streaming rather than Cinema; without MDBList
  as well, `CINEMA_ASSUMED_DIGITAL_DAYS` (default 60) treats a theatrical
  release older than that as Streaming, and the movieleaks cache still
  supplies Streaming earlier,
  a series gets its season and episode structure from Cinemeta's episode
  list (Mini Series, Binge Ready, New Season, Returning, Season Finale), and
  a Trending sash backed by a custom MDBList source no longer waits on a key
  it never needed.
- A verbatim `{tmdb_id}` or `{tmdb_id?}` on `/poster` and `/logo` is read as
  "no TMDB id", as `{imdb_id}` already was, so a client that leaves the
  placeholder in for a title it has no TMDB id for renders from the IMDb id
  instead of getting a malformed-id 400.

### Localization

- Added Polish (`pl`) poster-output translations, contributed by @skoruppa.
- Added poster-output translations for every configurator language the label
  font can draw: German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Greek,
  Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Romanian, Croatian, Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian,
  Turkish, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Swahili and Afrikaans. These are
  machine-assisted first drafts; corrections from native speakers are welcome.
  Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew, Hindi, Bengali,
  Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam stay untranslated: Inter has no glyphs for those
  scripts, and the image has no complex-text shaping to lay them out.
- French, Italian and Portuguese gained the 27–29 language-name sash labels
  they were missing, which previously rendered in English.
- The landscape badge uppercases its label the way the language does: Turkish
  `i` becomes `İ` rather than `I`, and Greek drops the tonos in capitals.
- The configurator marks every fully translated language with ★.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-09-20

This release is compared with `v1.1.0`.

### Highlights

- Added anime-native poster requests through AniList and Kitsu, with separate
  anime rating weights for MyAnimeList, AniList and Kitsu scores.
- Added a 16:9 landscape poster layout, poster-coloured vignettes, and frosted
  elements that match the painted vignette colour.
- Made IMDb ids optional: `tmdb_id` is the identity, so titles TMDB has no IMDb
  link for now render with ratings and sashes instead of failing.
- Added QualiCache as a quality source, so poster rendering answers from a
  shared cache instead of waiting on a scrape.
- Added MDBList-free rating inputs: TMDB's own vote average and IMDb's daily
  dataset, each usable as the primary source or as a fallback when MDBList has
  no value.
- Added background cache warming for trending, popular, and custom-catalog
  titles, with quota-aware MDBList spending, plus custom trending sources.
- Fixed festival sashes naming a top prize the film did not win; top prizes are
  now checked against Wikidata-built lists verified edition by edition.
- Redesigned the configurator with new presets, row tooltips, a title-link
  menu, and generated URLs about a third of their previous length.
- Hardened the server for cold-catalog bursts: fresh renders queue behind an
  admission cap, and the healthcheck no longer leaves zombie processes.
- Added Brazilian Portuguese translations and translated the remaining sash
  vocabulary in every shipped language.

### Anime

- Added anime-native poster requests through AniList and Kitsu. Clients that
  supply `anilist_id`, `kitsu_id`, or an AIOMetadata-compatible `{id}` can use
  the provider's cover art, title, genres, air dates, lifecycle status, and
  community score without converting the title to a TMDB or IMDb id.
- Added an off-by-default Anime IDs configurator option for AIOMetadata poster
  URLs. Anime-native ids are also carried through to compatible quality sources,
  so stream-quality badges continue to work when no IMDb id exists.
- Anime requests now keep any accompanying TMDB and IMDb ids for logos, MDBList
  ratings, awards, age ratings, release data, and other enrichment. AniList and
  Kitsu scores participate in the normal weighted-rating pipeline and default
  to zero weight.
- Anime cover art can receive a TMDB logo by default. If an anime provider is
  unavailable or misses a title, rendering temporarily falls back to TMDB art
  instead of a genre canvas without caching the degraded result.
- Improved anime provider caching, concurrency limits, genre selection, request
  identity, and placeholder handling. Definitive misses are negative-cached,
  while throttles and transient provider failures are not.

### Poster Rendering

- Added a dedicated 16:9 poster layout through `shape=landscape`, with backdrop
  artwork, height-relative sizing, a unified bottom information band, and clear
  top corners for client overlays. `landscape_art` selects textless or original
  artwork and `badge_pos` controls the age-rating badge position.
- Added poster-coloured top and bottom vignettes with saturation, blur,
  lightness, two-colour ramp, and blend controls. Tint selection now samples the
  artwork near the visible seam, rejects shadow-only and conflicting colours,
  and limits excessive chroma for more consistent results across a shelf.
- Frosted notches and bars can match the colour actually painted by a tinted
  vignette. Matching preserves the vignette's lightness and falls back to the
  normal frost colour when the band does not have a reliable tint.
- Posters confirmed to contain a baked-in title use a plain black vignette
  instead of blurring and tinting the title inside the artwork.
- Expanded Minimalist mode with a Split layout, optional centring, and separate
  field and rating separators. Pip, bullet, and rating-star treatments are
  exposed only where they apply, including the score-coloured separator in Year
  mode.
- Added independent notch padding so the space above and below a label can be
  tightened without shrinking the font, changing the badge width, or moving the
  notch.
- The release-status sash now shows the date an unreleased movie arrives, and
  where, when TMDB has published one — `Oct 16 Cinema`, `Oct 23 Streaming`, or
  `Dec 2027 Cinema` when it is a year or more away — instead of a bare
  `Cinema` / `Production`. In cinemas the date is the next digital or disc
  release; in production it is the first release anywhere. Translated in every
  shipped language, and switchable off with the new Release Status: Show Date
  toggle (`release_status_dates=false`).

### Configurator

- Redesigned the configurator with rounded panels, sentence-case group headings,
  text tabs, consistent spacing and controls, a cleaner preview panel, and
  refreshed preset and import dialogs across every settings tab.
- Reworked inline help into row tooltips that also work on touch devices, and
  improved control grouping, contrast, button styling, colour swatches, and the
  sash-priority editor.
- Moved Import from URL into the header and added a title-link menu with IMDb,
  TMDB artwork, MDBList, and SIMKL shortcuts. Fixed menu links that could open
  `#` before their targets were initialized.
- Generated poster URLs and presets no longer carry an `imdb_id` placeholder,
  which previously discarded the whole URL for any title without an IMDb link.
  A title with no linked IMDb id is now reported as a normal state rather than an
  error, previews load from the TMDB id alone, and the result is remembered for a
  week so the resolver is not re-run on every load.
- Plex and Jellyfin sync no longer skip library items that have a TMDB id but no
  IMDb id. Quality badges from the local file continue to work for those items,
  and an `imdb_id` baked into a copied recipe URL can no longer be applied to
  items it does not belong to.
- Wait for Quality is now sent for the Combined badge mode, which offered the
  toggle but left it out of the generated URL.

### Quality

- Added QualiCache as a quality source: set `QUALITY_SOURCE=qualicache` and
  `QUALICACHE_URL` (plus `QUALICACHE_API_KEY` if QualiCache sets an access key).
  QualiCache crawls Stremio addons in the background and answers from its own
  cache, so poster rendering no longer waits on a scrape and one instance can
  serve PostersPlus and other clients at once.
- Titles QualiCache hasn't collected yet report as pending rather than failed.
  The poster is served without badges and the composite isn't cached, so a later
  request picks the badges up — and a cold title no longer counts against the
  quality source's failure budget the way a real outage does.
- QualiCache `BLURAY` and `WEBRIP` answers now fold into the silver Web badge.
  Older shows whose best trusted release is an encode rather than a remux or
  WEB-DL (*Lost*, *Futurama*) previously showed no quality badge at all, since
  the source token was dropped and a resolution alone is never drawn. Only a
  true remux keeps gold. Tokens with no PostersPlus equivalent (`8K`, `1440P`,
  `720P`, `SD`, `HDTV`) are still dropped rather than approximated.
- Quality backend selection now runs through one dispatcher instead of being
  repeated at each call site. `/status` reports the active backend as
  `quality_source`.
- The Quality Bookmark badge mode now seeds Badge Size at 30 rather than 16.
  At 16 the corner mark was barely visible at the poster sizes most clients
  render at, so the mode looked like it hadn't worked. The right value varies
  by client, which the mode's tooltip now says.

### Ratings

- Added separate rating weights for anime. `anime_movie_weights` and
  `anime_tv_weights` take the same `source:weight` list as `movie_weights` /
  `tv_weights` and apply to any title carrying a MyAnimeList, AniList or Kitsu
  rating — MDBList supplies the MyAnimeList score for anime it knows, so this
  covers anime requested by ordinary TMDB/IMDb id as well as the anime-native
  path. Both are opt-in: a URL naming neither scores its anime with the movie
  and TV weights exactly as before, so nothing changes for existing URLs. The
  source lists are what MDBList actually returns for anime: anime films carry
  every movie source, while anime series never carry a Metacritic critic score
  or a Roger Ebert review (dropped) but do often carry Letterboxd (added). The
  Weights tab gains a **Separate Anime Weights** toggle that reveals the two
  groups, and `debug=1` now reports `is_anime` and the `rating_weights` used.
- Added an MDBList-free way to source two of the weighted rating inputs.
  `tmdb_rating_source=direct` uses TMDB's own vote average — already fetched
  alongside genre/year/credits, so it costs nothing extra and needs no MDBList
  key. `imdb_rating_source=dataset` sources the IMDb weight from IMDb's own
  free, no-key, daily-refreshed non-commercial dataset
  (`title.ratings.tsv.gz`), downloaded and refreshed on a schedule
  (`IMDB_DATASET_ENABLED`, `IMDB_DATASET_REFRESH_HOURS`,
  `IMDB_DATASET_MIN_VOTES`, `IMDB_DATASET_PATH`) and looked up locally with no
  per-title network call. Both default to the existing MDBList-sourced
  behaviour and are exposed as dropdowns on the Weights tab, and either can be
  used with zero MDBList key configured.
- Both settings also take `fallback`, which keeps MDBList as the source of
  truth and consults the local source only when MDBList has no value for that
  title. That covers a hard gap — a rate-limited or exhausted key, a timeout,
  every configured key cooling down — and a soft gap, where MDBList answered
  but carried no score for the title (or one `RATING_MIN_VOTES` filtered out),
  with the same rule. `tmdb_rating_source=fallback` needs no server-side setup
  at all, which makes it the cheapest way to keep scores alive through an
  MDBList outage. This is a different layer from `fallback_to_imdb`: that one
  fires when the *weights* score nothing and reaches for whatever `imdb` value
  is present, whereas these put a value there for it to find. They compose.
- The configurator now disables the two dataset-backed IMDb source options
  when `IMDB_DATASET_ENABLED` is off server-side, and coerces an imported URL
  that names one back to `mdblist`. Selecting an option the server can't
  honour produced a URL that looked configured and silently scored `N/A`.
  `/server-caps` already reported the state; nothing was reading it.
- Only one worker per interval downloads the IMDb dataset. With `WORKERS` > 1
  every worker ran its own copy of the refresh loop against the same
  database, so the losers of the table swap failed with `database is locked`
  and — worse — kept a stale row count, which left them reporting an empty
  dataset on `/server-caps` and splitting the composite cache signature.
- Corrected `.env.example`'s `MDBLIST_API_KEY` documentation, which called it
  `[Required]`; it has been optional in the request path for some time (see
  the "IMDb ids are now optional" entry above) and is now spelled out exactly
  which sashes and the score are unavailable without it.

### Metadata And Caching

- Poster responses now advertise the composite's own expiry, so a caching client
  keeps a trending-sashed poster for a day and a settled title for the full
  `COMPOSITE_CACHE_TTL`. A configured `CDN_CACHE_TTL` acts as a ceiling the
  deadline can lower, `CDN_CACHE_TTL=auto` drops the ceiling, and `0` still
  sends no `Cache-Control`. `304` responses carry the same freshness.

- IMDb ids are now optional. `tmdb_id` is the required identity — it selects the
  artwork and metadata — and `imdb_id` is optional enrichment. Titles TMDB has no
  IMDb link for previously returned an error and, through AIOMetadata, lost their
  poster entirely because a required placeholder with no value discards the whole
  URL. Existing URLs that send both ids are unchanged.
- Ratings, awards, keywords, and age ratings are now looked up through MDBList's
  TMDB route when no IMDb id is available, so TMDB-only titles keep their score
  and sashes. A title MDBList does not know still renders from TMDB metadata with
  an `N/A` score.
- Stream-quality lookups now resolve their id after metadata, so a title whose URL
  omits `imdb_id` still gets quality badges via the IMDb id TMDB itself supplies.
  Anime keeps its provider-native id for these lookups. Titles with no IMDb id
  anywhere skip the lookup rather than issuing one nothing can answer; an explicit
  `quality=` override is unaffected.
- Rating cache, coalescing, and back-off state are now keyed on one immutable
  per-request identity (`tmdb:<id>` when there is no IMDb id) rather than the raw
  `imdb_id` parameter. Cache warming writes the same identity the request path
  reads. Metahub logo fallback, digital-release detection, and IMDb links run only
  when an IMDb id is actually available.
- `/poster?debug=1` now reports the resolved identities — `canonical_id`,
  `rating_provider`, `rating_media_id`, `quality_id`, and `effective_imdb_id`.
- Added `TRENDING_SOURCE_MOVIE` and `TRENDING_SOURCE_TV` so operators can replace
  TMDB's global trending list with an MDBList page or a TMDB-shaped endpoint.
  The configured order drives both trending sashes and cache warming, enabling
  regional or service-specific rankings.
- Custom trending sources now isolate movie and TV entries, reject rows without
  numeric TMDB ids, follow canonical MDBList URLs, refresh cleanly when the
  configured source changes, and avoid exposing credentials or query strings in
  cache signatures and logs.
- Release-status caches now use status-aware lifetimes: active, in-production,
  and cinema titles refresh quickly, while ended, cancelled, physical, and
  established streaming releases remain cached longer. Known release dates set
  the next refresh boundary directly.
- Composite posters now expire no later than the release data rendered into
  them. Disk and in-memory cache entries share the same deadline, and cache
  warming reuses the trending snapshot it already fetched.
- Rating-provider failure counters are now pruned together with their expired
  backoff state.
- Renamed the award sash labels so winners and nominees no longer share the
  same text: "Best Picture" / "Golden Globe" became "Oscar Winner" / "Oscar
  Nominee" and "Globe Winner" / "Globe Nominee", in every shipped language.
  A new `sash_winner_star` toggle prefixes winners with a star, replacing the
  old heuristic that guessed from the shared label.
- Fixed movies wearing TV awards. TMDB movie and TV ids are separate
  namespaces, but the Emmy and Golden Globe id lists were searched as one, so
  *Back to the Future* (movie/105) inherited *Sex and the City*'s Emmy and
  *Donnie Darko* (movie/141) inherited *Cheers*'s. Lookups now use the film or
  TV lists by media type, and cached rating rows rebuild their Globe / Emmy
  labels on read so existing rows correct themselves.
- Fixed unreleased movies reading `Streaming`. TMDB flips a film to `Released`
  ahead of its first date, and limited-theatrical and festival-premiere dates
  were not being read at all, so a title like *You Can See Everything* (two
  festival premieres, limited release in October) had no dates to contradict
  the flag. Limited releases now count as theatrical, a future premiere counts
  as proof the film is not out, and cached rows that recorded no dates are
  re-fetched once.

### Performance And Reliability

- Reduced startup memory by loading genre fallback backgrounds on demand into a
  bounded cache instead of decoding the whole gallery, and reduced per-thread
  SQLite page-cache memory. Fallback fonts are now cached as well.
- Made fallback-title rendering faster and more reliable by starting font
  fitting from a monotonic width search, fitting long titles rather than cutting
  them off, and ellipsizing every landscape fallback line that needs it.
- Reduced score and quality-bar composition work by drawing only the affected
  strips instead of repeatedly compositing full-canvas layers.
- OCR thread sizing now respects the container's actual cgroup CPU quota rather
  than the host CPU count. `TEXTLESS_DETECTION_CONCURRENCY` now defaults to `1`
  to avoid slower scans and roughly 50 MB of unnecessary memory per idle
  session; larger values remain available for cold-cache library sweeps.
- Landscape requests no longer wait for quality data the layout does not render,
  and transient custom-trending failures use a short retry cooldown rather than
  refetching once per poster.
- A burst of uncached poster requests — a cold catalog or tabbed grid asking
  for 50+ posters in a second — no longer fails en masse with `PoolTimeout`.
  Fresh renders now queue behind a per-worker admission cap
  (`POSTER_RENDER_CONCURRENCY`, default `8`); cache hits and requests coalesced
  onto an in-flight render are never held back. The upstream connection pool is
  sized from that cap, and a request waits up to 10 seconds for a connection
  rather than 5. `/stats` reports `renders_active`, `renders_queued` and
  `render_slots`.
- Cache warming no longer drains a free MDBList key's daily quota. MDBList's
  limit is 1,000 requests per key per day (more on paid tiers), not a burst
  limit, and the default `CACHE_WARM_MDBLIST_BUDGET` of 500 took half of it in
  one cycle — leaving live poster requests to 429 for the rest of the day.
  Every MDBList response reports the remaining quota, and the warmer now
  reads it: it stops spending a key once its remaining requests fall to
  `CACHE_WARM_MDBLIST_RESERVE` (default `300`), moving to `MDBLIST_API_KEY_2`
  when that key still has room, and never drags live traffic off a key that
  is merely at its reserve. A quota 429, which carries no `Retry-After`, now
  parks the key until MDBList's own reset time instead of retrying hourly
  against a key that is dead until midnight UTC. `/stats` reports each key's
  `daily_limit`, `daily_remaining` and `quota_reset_at`.
- The container no longer accumulates zombie `python3` processes under load.
  The Docker healthcheck ran through a shell, so a probe that overran its 5s
  timeout on a busy host left an orphaned `python3` that nothing reaped. The
  probe now runs without a shell, imports less, and gets 10s; `tini` is PID 1
  so any orphan is reaped regardless.

### Configurator

- Generated poster URLs are about a third of their previous length - roughly
  1500 characters down to 450 on the shipped presets. Some metadata services
  truncate or reject URLs past 2000 characters, and most of what was there
  restated settings the server would have chosen anyway. Three changes get it
  there: parameters already at their default are left out, `sash_priority` is
  sent as a diff against the default order, and rating sources weighted at zero
  are no longer named. The server parses the result identically and every URL
  generated before this keeps working unchanged.
- `sash_priority` now accepts a diff form: `default,-cult,festival@0` removes
  the cult sash and promotes the festival one, instead of listing all thirty
  slots. The full list is still accepted and still means what it always did.
- The defaults the configurator omits are read from the server at load time
  rather than restated in the page, so they cannot drift apart. If the server
  cannot be reached the full-length URL is generated instead.
- Replaced the ten shipped presets with a new set — tinted minimalist,
  colour-matched bar/notch/sash, and rating-bar variants — with WebP
  screenshots.
- Fixed a rating or sash text colour that, once typed, came back after every
  container rebuild even after being cleared. The reset-on-load skipped hex
  text boxes and an imported URL that omitted the parameter left the old value
  in place; both now clear to the server default.

### Fixes And Documentation

- Fixed festival sashes naming a top prize the film did not win. MDblist tags a
  title `festival-cannes-winner` if it won *anything* at Cannes, and that was
  read as "Palme d'Or" — so the whole 2023 slate, from the Grand Prix winner
  down to the Un Certain Regard one, wore a Palme d'Or sash — nine films, of
  which one had won it. Every festival in the list had the same fault.
  The top prize is now looked up by TMDB id against a list built from Wikidata,
  and the keyword only supports the weaker claim it can actually carry: a title
  that won something at Cannes but not the Palme reads "Cannes Winner". A top
  prize now also shows when MDblist is unreachable, since the list is local.
  Cached titles convert on first startup without re-fetching anything.
- Cross-checked every top-prize list against the festivals' own winners tables,
  edition by edition. That restored 34 winners the first source had no record
  of — Joker's 2019 Golden Lion, four recent Locarno Leopards, Cannes' 1946
  eleven-way tie — each of which had been showing the weaker sash.
- Removed 9 films that were wearing a top prize they did not win. Three were
  Golden Bear winners for Best Short Film rather than the Golden Bear, two were
  Berlinale and Locarno sidebar prizes, and one was a mismatched id: Precious
  premiered at Sundance as "Push: Based on the Novel by Sapphire", and its Grand
  Jury Prize had landed on the unrelated 2009 science-fiction film Push, which
  wore the sash while Precious went without.
- Removed the Toronto, Busan, Rotterdam, SXSW and Tribeca festival sashes. Their
  labels — People's Choice, New Currents, Tiger Award, SXSW Jury, Tribeca AA —
  named specific prizes no available source can confirm, and unlike the five
  festivals that remain there is no list to check them against. Cannes, Venice,
  Berlin, Locarno and Sundance are unaffected.
- Fixed quality badges never appearing unless Wait for Quality was on. A poster
  served before its quality arrived was correctly kept out of the composite
  cache, but still carried an ETag identical to the finished render's, so
  clients and CDNs revalidated their badge-less copy and were told it was still
  current. Renders the server declines to keep now ship no validator and ask not
  to be stored. Clients holding a badge-less poster from before this fix keep it
  until the composite TTL lapses or the URL changes.
- Fixed missing ratings leaving an empty score in the information strip, and
  fixed fallback titles that could be clipped instead of resized to fit.
- Fixed landscape fallbacks losing their title, TV shows retaining a stale
  ended status after revival, and release sashes surviving past a newly reached
  digital-release boundary.
- Added the 78th Emmy (2026) winners and nominees to the award sash data.
- Split the oversized `.env.example` into a concise starter configuration and a
  new `ADVANCED.md` tuning reference. Added previously undocumented OCR and face
  model path overrides and corrected OCR concurrency guidance and defaults.

### Localization

- Added Brazilian Portuguese (`pt-br`) poster-output translations, contributed
  by @danilopagotto82.
- Region-qualified translation files take precedence over the bare language, so
  a `pt-br` request uses `languages/pt-br.json` rather than `languages/pt.json`.
  Selecting `pt-br` also restricts logo artwork to Brazil-tagged entries,
  falling back to English rather than to Portugal-tagged art.
- Translated the remaining fixed sash vocabulary in every shipped language: the
  release-status labels (`Physical`, `Streaming`, `Cinema`, `Production`,
  `Airing`, `Ended`, `Cancelled`) and the ten festival winner labels, from
  `Palme d'Or` through `Tribeca AA`. Previously these rendered in English on an
  otherwise translated poster.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-06-09

This release is compared with the original `v1.0.0` release. It also includes
the maintenance fixes published in the v1.0.x releases.

### Highlights

- Added several new poster layouts, including Frosted Bar, Minimalist, Clean,
  and expanded quality and age-rating treatments.
- Rebuilt textless-poster validation around the PP-OCRv5 Mobile detector, with
  background scanning and load controls for live installations.
- Added smarter TMDB poster selection so a tiny number of votes cannot easily
  promote a badly rated poster over substantially better artwork.
- Expanded artwork selection with original-art controls, language-aware poster
  matching, improved logo fallback, and face- and saliency-aware cropping.
- Added a preset gallery and reorganized the configurator into a mobile-friendly
  tabbed interface.
- Added poster-output translations for French, Portuguese, and Italian.

### Poster Rendering

- Added independent top and bottom vignette controls with Off, Low, Medium, and
  High strengths.
- Added Frosted Bar mode with:
  - Frosted, black, silver, gold, and rating-focused styles.
  - Optional rating, year, and sash content.
  - Rating progress and out-of-ten display variants.
  - Poster-derived tinting that can be shared with the sash notch.
- Expanded Minimalist mode with improved title, metadata, and fallback-art
  presentation.
- Added Clean mode for a restrained score and metadata layout.
- Added poster-derived sash colors and an option to match the Frosted Bar.
- Added diagonal, notch, and hidden sash display modes.
- Added filled and frosted notch styles.
- Split sash sizing into dedicated width, height, inset, and font controls.
- Added winner-star treatment for selected award sashes.
- Added release-status sashes for BluRay, Streaming, Cinema, and Production.
- Added greyscale treatments for Cinema and Production releases.
- Added options to keep release artwork in color when stream quality is known,
  or use greyscale when no quality is available.
- Added six quality display choices covering the quality notch, quality with
  age rating, badge row, combined text badge, age rating only, and hidden output.
- Added a minimum quality threshold (`badge_min_score`) to all quality display
  modes. When set, the badge is suppressed for streams whose quality score falls
  below the configured value; no-data states are always rendered regardless.
- Added age-rating badges and tracking.
- Improved score bars, badge alignment, spacing, gradients, metadata placement,
  and long-title handling across layouts.

### Artwork And Logos

- Added a Primary or Top Rated source selector for original artwork.
- Added language-aware poster selection, including support for original artwork
  in the requested language.
- Improved logo selection priority across requested, native, original, and text
  fallbacks.
- Added Metahub as an additional logo fallback.
- Added configurable logo sizing and safer contrast and stretch behavior.
- Added face-aware and saliency-aware backdrop cropping.
- Added text-aware crop selection to reduce accidental clipping of useful
  artwork.
- Added minimalist and photoreal genre fallback backgrounds.
- Improved title fallback rendering when no usable logo is available.
- Added a fallback gallery endpoint for reviewing generated title and genre
  artwork.

### Textless Poster Detection

- Replaced the previous EAST detector with PP-OCRv5 Mobile.
- Added title-aware OCR rules to detect posters incorrectly marked as textless
  while avoiding rejection solely for a matching standalone logo.
- Added specialized handling for wide, low-contrast, repeated, and
  design-integrated text.
- Added versioned detection signatures so tuning changes invalidate stale OCR
  results automatically.
- Added a deduplicated cache-volume report of TMDB posters that OCR identifies
  as incorrectly marked textless, including direct review links.
- Added request coalescing so simultaneous requests for the same poster share a
  single scan.
- Added a dedicated text-detection executor with configurable concurrency.
- Added foreground vote gating to keep uncached burst traffic responsive:
  - Posters at or below the configured vote limit are scanned during the request.
  - Posters above the limit are served without caching the composite and queued
    for an idle background scan.
  - Once the background scan completes, later requests use the cached detection
    result and can cache the completed composite normally.
- Bundled the compact detector model in standard Docker builds by default.

### TMDB Poster Selection

- Added a minimum-vote preference when ranking textless poster candidates.
- Preserved the previous selection behavior when no candidate reaches the
  minimum vote count.
- Added a maximum score-drop safeguard so vote confidence cannot promote a
  heavily downvoted poster over much better-rated artwork.
- Included the ranking policy in cache signatures so selection-setting changes
  take effect without manual cache removal.

### Ratings

- Added a minimum vote count for rating providers. Scores with fewer than 10
  votes are ignored by default.
- Exempted Roger Ebert from the vote minimum because its source represents a
  single critic rating.
- Added a per-configuration "Fallback to IMDb" toggle. When enabled, IMDb is
  used only if the selected weighted sources produce no score.
- Improved normalization, missing-provider handling, and provider metadata
  caching.
- Added MDBList secondary API key rotation and rate-limit backoff.
- Improved cache invalidation when rating policy or provider metadata changes.
- Refined the default movie weighting toward Letterboxd with Trakt as a
  low-weight fallback.

### Quality And Release Data

- Added Stremio scraper support as an alternative quality source.
- Improved AIOStreams quality parsing and quality-token normalization.
- Improved digital release synchronization and release-status prioritization.
- Improved background quality refresh behavior and failure handling.
- Added server capability reporting so the configurator can hide unsupported
  options cleanly.

### Configurator

- Rebuilt the configurator as a tabbed interface covering Core, Rating, Logo,
  Sash, Quality, and Weights settings.
- Added a preset gallery with ready-made poster styles.
- Added settings persistence in the browser.
- Restored importing an existing Posters Plus URL for editing.
- Added editable values alongside range sliders.
- Added expanded preview and crop simulation.
- Added controls for original artwork, poster language behavior, logo sizing,
  sash styles, Frosted Bar, age ratings, release colors, and the IMDb fallback.
- Added a light/dark mode toggle to the header. Preference persists in the
  browser across sessions.
- Improved responsive and mobile layouts.
- Improved generated URL handling when the server is accessed over a LAN.
- Added a composite-cache toggle for testing and troubleshooting.
- Updated default values: top vignette defaults to Medium (was High),
  minimalist rating horizontal position defaults to 0.065 (was 0.05), match
  notch color for Frosted Bar modes is enabled by default, diagonal sash height
  defaults to 0.135 (was 0.12), diagonal sash corner distance defaults to 1.20
  (was 1.15), minimum quality threshold defaults to score 5 for Badge Row /
  Quality Notch / Combined Text Badge modes and score 2 for Quality Age Rating
  mode, and IMDb fallback is enabled by default.
- Updated preset gallery: all presets now include the IMDb fallback setting.
- Updated Primary Client selector label to list Plex and Jellyfin alongside
  Stremio TV and Nuvio, reflecting the shared flush-edge inset profile.

### Plex and Jellyfin Sync

- Added `plex_sync.py`, a companion script that reads a Plex library, derives
  quality tokens from each title's actual media file metadata, and pushes
  PostersPlus-generated posters back as library covers.
- Added `jellyfin_sync.py`, a companion script with the same workflow for
  Jellyfin libraries, using the Jellyfin REST API directly without a
  third-party SDK.
- Both scripts detect resolution, HDR format, audio codec, and release type
  (Remux, WEB-DL) from file paths and stream display titles.
- Both scripts include an `--inspect` mode that logs derived quality tokens for
  every library title without writing any posters, making it easy to audit
  token derivation against known titles before a full sync.
- TV show quality is derived from a representative episode selected by watch
  progress, air date, and episode count.

### Localization

- Added French, Portuguese, and Italian poster-output translations.
- Added translated genre and sash labels.
- Poster translations follow the selected logo language.
- Missing translation keys fall back to English individually.

### Performance And Reliability

- Changed the default Uvicorn worker count from 2 to 1. A single worker avoids
  loading duplicate OCR models and was faster in testing for typical installs.
- Set text-detection concurrency to 2 by default.
- Added in-flight request coalescing for expensive shared work.
- Hardened SQLite use with WAL mode, busy timeouts, retry handling, and safer
  multi-request cache writes.
- Added cache pruning, reclaim, and vacuum maintenance.
- Improved metadata, logo, poster, rating, and composite cache invalidation.
- Improved handling of stale cache rebuilds and large request bursts.
- Improved Docker builds for amd64 and arm64, including reliable multi-platform
  `latest` publishing.
- Added more detailed diagnostics for text detection, artwork selection, cache
  behavior, quality lookup, and render timing.

### Fixes

- Fixed several false-positive and false-negative text detections found during
  broad real-world poster testing.
- Fixed stale OCR results surviving detector or threshold changes.
- Fixed cases where a skipped textless scan could be treated as a final cached
  decision.
- Fixed duplicate work when many requests asked for the same uncached poster.
- Fixed edge cases in poster ranking with very small or negative vote samples.
- Fixed logo fallback, logo contrast, and oversized-logo edge cases.
- Fixed missing or malformed metadata causing incomplete poster renders.
- Fixed score-bar totals, normalization text, and missing-provider behavior.
- Fixed sash and quality visibility interactions.
- Fixed configurator spacing, slider, dropdown, preview, and mobile layout
  issues.
- Fixed backdrop crop centering on false-positive face detections, where a
  large low-confidence background blob could outrank a smaller, genuinely
  detected face on bounding-box size alone.
- Fixed Docker workflow races that could publish an older image as `latest`.

### Upgrade Notes

#### Recommended defaults

```env
WORKERS=1
TEXTLESS_DETECTION_CONCURRENCY=2
TEXTLESS_DETECTION_MAX_VOTES=3000
RATING_MIN_VOTES=10
TMDB_POSTER_MIN_VOTES=3
TMDB_POSTER_MAX_SCORE_DROP=1.0
PPOCR_BOX_THRESHOLD=0.70
PPOCR_WIDE_BOX_THRESHOLD=0.30
PPOCR_WIDE_MIN_ASPECT=3.0
PPOCR_WIDE_MIN_AREA=0.01
PPOCR_WIDE_MIN_Y=0.55
TEXTLESS_SCAN_TOP=0.08
BAKE_PPOCR_MODEL=true
```

- Keep `WORKERS x TEXTLESS_DETECTION_CONCURRENCY` at or below the number of
  available CPU cores unless the host has been tested under realistic load.
- Larger values can improve short bursts on powerful systems, but also increase
  CPU contention, memory use, duplicate model memory across workers, and
  pressure on SQLite.
- `TEXTLESS_DETECTION_MAX_VOTES` controls the foreground speed versus immediate
  detection tradeoff. Lower values defer more scans; higher values scan more
  posters before responding.

#### Text detector migration

- EAST has been replaced by PP-OCRv5 Mobile.
- Existing EAST settings such as `TEXTLESS_MIN_BOXES`, `EAST_INPUT_WIDTH`,
  `EAST_INPUT_HEIGHT`, `EAST_MODEL_URL`, `EAST_MODEL_PATH`, and
  `BAKE_EAST_MODEL` are no longer used.
- Standard Docker images include the PP-OCR detector model. Builds with
  `BAKE_PPOCR_MODEL=false` download it into the model cache at runtime.

#### Compatibility

- Existing v1.0 poster URLs remain supported.
- Legacy sash and quality parameters continue to map to their current
  equivalents.
- The `combined_badge_min_score` URL parameter is accepted as a fallback for
  `badge_min_score` so existing Combined Text Badge URLs continue to work.
- Compact mode, which appeared during v1.1 development, was replaced by Frosted
  Bar before release.
- Cache schema migrations run automatically.
- Rating, artwork-selection, OCR, and composite signatures automatically refresh
  results affected by changed policies.
- The IMDb fallback is stored in the generated configuration URL and does not
  require a server environment variable.

### Included v1.0.x Maintenance

- Corrected release and Docker publishing workflows.
- Fixed showcase and documentation links.
- Improved multi-platform image publishing and `latest` tag consistency.
