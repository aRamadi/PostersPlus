                             every other source.
      "dataset"            — always override. MDBList is not consulted for
                             this one source at all, so the weight works
                             with no MDBList key configured.

                             does not.

    "fallback" is the mode that pays off for operators who do use MDBList,

    rate-limited, timed out, or every configured key is cooling down, so
    the failure path arrives here with an empty dict. And a soft gap:
    MDBList answered fine but carried no IMDb score for this title, or
    carried one that RATING_MIN_VOTES filtered out. Both look identical
    from here — "imdb" is absent — so both are covered by testing for its
    absence rather than by inspecting how the fetch went.

    Note the deliberate asymmetry with fallback_to_imdb, which is a
    *scoring* fallback: it fires when no weighted source scored at all and
    reaches for whatever "imdb" value is present. This one fires earlier,
    at the point the ratings are assembled, and is what puts a value there
    for it to find. The two compose: dataset backfill, then weighting,
    then fallback_to_imdb if the weights still produced nothing.

    reason a poster whose bottom is white cloud reads pale next to one whose bottom
    is dark, at identical settings — the tint contributes the same to both.  This
    scales the bright case down so the bleed-through is comparable, weighted by the
    same alpha ramp so there is no seam, and scaled by ``amount`` — how hard the
    two sliders are asking for a wash at all — so a faint one doesn't aggressively
    regrade the poster.

    ``amount`` deliberately does *not* include the tint's confidence.  Hue
    confidence answers "is this the poster's colour", which has nothing to do with
    how much art should show through; letting it in meant the posters whose hue was
    least trusted — the near-monochrome ones — were also the only ones that kept
    their art legible under the band, which is exactly the inconsistency this
    function exists to remove.

    The bleed is judged locally, over a wide blur of the art's luminance, not as
    one mean for the whole band.  A single scale factor treated a band that is
    half white cloud and half shadow as uniformly mid-grey: the cloud still
    punched through as a bright patch in the fog, and the shadow was darkened for
    nothing.  Levelling each region to the same budget is what makes the fog read
    as one even density across the width.  The blur is wide enough that the

    ``box`` is the band's crop rect in ``src`` — the artwork snapshot taken
    *before* any gradient darkened it, since sampling the graded image would just
    return the near-black a previous band already painted.

    ``blur`` (0–1) trades local colour for the whole-poster ``dominant``: at 0 the
    band follows the art across its width (a red left edge stays red), at 1 it is
    one flat wash of the dominant colour.  It drives both the coarseness of the
    downsample and the mix toward the dominant, each on its own front-loaded curve
    (see _VIGNETTE_BLUR_*_CURVE) so the two ends read as clearly different.  The
    same slider also frosts the art itself — see _vignette_frost_band, which is
    what makes the high end read as blur rather than as a flat colour cast.

    ``dominant`` / ``secondary`` are colours the poster actually has (see
    _fog_pick), and every cell of the band is painted as a darker shade of the
    colour under it — its own hue and nearly its own chroma, at a lightness white
    labels read on.  See _fog_paint for the mapping and why the fog follows the
    art rather than landing at one fixed intensity.

    ``confidence`` (0–1) is how far the colour is to be trusted; it drains chroma
    and some lightness, so an untrustworthy pick fades toward a dark neutral.
    ``saturation`` (0–_VIGNETTE_SAT_FULL) scales chroma around the tuned default;
    0 is exactly black, i.e. the untinted vignette.  ``lightness`` scales the
    fog's lightness around its tuned default.  ``cover_lightness`` is the OKLab
    lightness of the art the band covers, which the fog leans toward a little so
    a dark poster's fog stays dark.

    ``style`` picks the mapping (see RequestConfig.vignette_color_style).
    "muted" paints a calm, dark, low-colour tone instead (_fog_paint_muted).
    "reference" skips both and paints each cell the poster's colour as
    it is — the frosted notch's match mode, for the band.  _fog_paint can only
    offer a colour in shade, and some colours have no shade that still reads as
    them: darkened, The Wire's pale yellow is olive, and shifted warm to avoid
    that it is orange.  Both sliders are ignored here; confidence still fades an
    untrustworthy pick toward black.

    ``columns`` / ``ramp_columns`` are the cell counts the two defaults above
    describe for a 500px band; a wider canvas passes its own so the local end
    of the blur slider stays as fine as it is on a poster (see landscape.py).

# "3": photoreal genre fallback backgrounds now render at the poster canvas size

# "4": the tinted vignette no longer frosts posters with confirmed burned-in
#      text, so composites cached with a blurred-over title must be re-rendered.
# "5": mode 6 adds a tier-coloured bookmark at the poster top-left corner.
# "6": the mode 6 bookmark is redrawn with rounded tips and a curved inner edge,
#      so composites cached with the old hard-edged triangle look stale.
# "7": landscape layout retuned — shallower band, larger shadowed info pill,
#      logo no longer capped by the band, wide logos preferred — so every
#      landscape composite cached before it is the old layout.
# "8": the diagonal sash is drawn straight onto the corner instead of as a
#      rotated strip, and the frost/notch blurs upscale bilinearly — sub-pixel
#      differences only, but bumped so clients pick up the faster renderer.
# "9": the sash is drawn by Skia at 1x and the frosted notch at 1x — label
#      glyphs are anti-aliased differently, so cached composites are re-drawn.

#   applies(cfg)      — the settings it touches.  Checked on every cache hit
#                       with nothing but the parsed config, so a request no
#                       revision applies to pays nothing extra.
#   stale(cfg, facts) — whether a poster cached before the revision drew
#                       something it changes.  *facts* is what the render
#                       recorded about itself (_render_facts); None for a
#                       composite cached before facts were recorded, which
#                       the revision decides about on its own terms.
# A composite cached at an older revision that both say yes to is treated as a
# miss and re-rendered; everything else keeps its entry.  Each composite stores
# the revision it was made at, so it is only ever checked against revisions
# newer than itself.  A revision that needs a fact nobody records yet has to
# add it to _render_facts too — every poster cached before then reads as not
# having it.
#
# Use _RENDER_CACHE_VERSION for a change that alters every poster; add a
# revision here when it can say which ones.  Revisions are append-only: rev
