"""
Landscape (16:9) poster rendering.

Deliberately a separate renderer rather than a mode inside ``build_poster``.
Almost every anchor in the portrait layout is keyed to *width* — the diagonal
sash, the badge row, the rating bar, the logo box — and on a canvas that is
twice as wide and 40% shorter every one of them lands wrong.  The portrait
vocabulary does not survive the aspect change, so this file owns its own.

Layout, all fractions of the canvas:

    +--------------------------------------------------+
    |  [badge]                              [badge]    |   top_left / top_right
    |                                                  |
    |                                                  |
    |......................vignette....................|   band, _BOTTOM_LEVELS
    |  LOGO  (or title)              Genre | Yr | 87   |
    +--------------------------------------------------+

Three rules govern the whole thing:

  * **Sizes key off height, positions off both.**  A width-derived font on a
    1000x563 canvas is nearly three times its optical size on 500x750.
  * **Both top corners stay clear of anything load-bearing.**  Stremio draws its
    watched check and hover-dismiss top-left, Nuvio draws its watched badge
    top-right; each takes roughly 11% of width by 20% of height.  The badge is
    placed inside that zone only because the user asked for it — it is a glass
    pill, so a small circle overlapping its leading corner stays readable.
  * **Baselines sit above 0.85 h**, clearing Stremio's continue-watching
    progress bar.

The tinted vignette is the one part of the portrait system that transfers
unchanged, and improves: its colour ramp already runs left-to-right across the
band, so twice the width gives it twice the runway.  Its helpers live in
main.py and are imported at call time — the same late-import idiom tvdb.py uses
for tmdb internals — to keep this module free of a circular import.

    ``source`` replaces the colour the pill would sample for itself — the

    because the lift is what makes the pill legible on whatever it lands on:
    the link shares the hue, not the vignette's darkness.

    Same construction as the portrait frosted notch, and deliberately the same
    helpers: a blurred crop of what the pill sits on, under a tint layer whose
    colour comes from the art rather than from the crop.  Sampling the whole
    frame rather than the region under the pill is what keeps it agreeing with
    the vignette — a local sample would put a different colour under a top-left
    badge than under a bottom-left one on the same poster.

    ``_LANDSCAPE_FROST_MODE`` picks how that colour is used:
      "match" — the colour as it came, lightness included, floored short of
                black.  Keeps a dark poster dark, so the pill still reads as
                smoked glass rather than becoming a bright chip.

    ``order`` (meta_order) rearranges the three, "year,genre,rating" and so on.

    ``align`` is the side it hangs from: "right" beside a left logo (the
    default), "left" beside a right one, "center" under a centred one.
    ``bounds`` (left x, right x) is the room it may use, in place of keeping
    clear of ``logo_left`` / ``logo_right``.  It sits on ``baseline`` (the
    shared one by default), or hangs from ``top``.  Returns the box its text
    takes (left, top of the caps, right, baseline), or None when nothing is
    drawn — what a stacked logo or a badge keeps clear of.

    Drawn right-to-left so the score stays pinned to the right edge whatever the
    genre string does, and the whole strip is measured before anything is drawn
    so a long genre can be dropped rather than colliding with the logo.

    ``scale`` (landscape_info_scale) sizes the text and its shadow together;
    the baseline and right edge stay put, so it grows up and to the left.

    ``logo_right`` is where the logo (or title) actually ends.  The strip keeps
    clear of that rather than of the widest a logo is ever allowed to be: with
    the maximum reserved, a narrow logo still cost the strip its genre, and at
    any enlarged size it lost it every time.  None falls back to the maximum.

    ``out_of_10`` prints the score the way portrait's out-of-10 switches do:
    one decimal ("8.7", "8.0"), with a bare "10" at the top.

    ``star`` labels the score the way Clean does on a portrait: the separator
    in front of it becomes a ★ (`Genre • Year ★ 87`), or a lone score gets
    one of its own.  The star is the text's colour, not the separator's —
    it names the number rather than dividing the row.

    ``rating_items`` (landscape_rating_badges) puts those sites' scores,
    each behind its logo, where the score was, in ``badge_scale`` and
    ``badge_style`` (rating_badges.rating_run); the ★ goes, as the badges
    stand in for it.  Short of room they drop from the end, after the genre
    and the year, keeping the first.
